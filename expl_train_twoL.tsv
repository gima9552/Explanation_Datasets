Unlike other patients who benefited from the chemotherapy drug, this particular patient had a unique genetic mutation that caused resistance to the medication's active components.	positive
While Patient A had a robust immune response leading to the production of protective antibodies, Patient B had a pre-existing condition that suppressed their immune response, rendering the vaccine less effective.	positive
Contrary to younger individuals who metabolize the drug efficiently, elderly patients often have reduced liver and kidney functions, leading to the drug accumulating in their system and causing side effects.	positive
Such behavior was analyzed and explained by Salmas and Androutsopoulos [58]: due to geometric restrictions, the uptake of molecules on the highly curved cylindrical surface is much less efficient than on the flat surface.	positive
Because then the treatment can be performed at early stage when the cancer cells still are confined in the organ and less likely to metastasize outside of the organ and therefore, the curative rate is always very high, which is supported by numerous clinical evidences that prostate cancer at an early stage is entirely curable, but not the cancer at late stage.	positive
However, the results from CDX studies often do not correlate with the results from clinical studies, partly because cancer cell lines fail to represent the true complexity and heterogeneity of tumors (reviewed in [1,2,3]).	positive
Specifically, mothers explained that they would not choose something that they did not like, because they would not know how to cook or prepare it, because it was unpleasant to think of preparing a disliked food, because they as mothers would have to eat that food, and finally because there are so many food options, so why choose a food that they did not like.	positive
A study comparing active and passive cycling found that most cortical activation during passive cycling is elicited by sensory feedback because of the moving limbs [30].	positive
Williams and colleagues also observed that miR206 upregulation after denervation was higher in fast-twitch fibers than in slow-twitch fibers, probably because slow-twitch fibers express higher levels of miR206 in physiological conditions [65].	positive

Forcing mice to run using an electric shock has likely introduces biases in the results because of the stress that is induced in the animals.	positive
Liquid formulations are the most common in paediatrics because of their easy administration.	positive
Broad spectrum antibiotics are used because culture data may not identify the infecting bacteria or this information may not be available at the time of operation [7,8].	positive
As a result, most global regulatory agencies restrict the use of dyes such as tartrazine, because azo dyes have been linked to hypersensitivity and ADHD reactions in children.	positive
"One potential explanation regarding ""what drives SCC initiation or development"" may be that the accumulation of oncogenic mutations working in concert with each other more potently drives tumor formation than individual genomic aberrations."	positive
Multiples lines of evidence demonstrating the in vitro ability of Nrf2 inhibition to sensitize SCCs to chemotherapy make Nrf2 an attractive target for evaluation in clinical trials.6.4.	positive
The scientific literature suggests that most commercialized drugs are not suitable to be used on the paediatric population, as they are presented in an inappropriate pharmaceutical dosage or form, or because of the excipients they contain.	positive
Because the sorption processes tend to be exothermic, and because the sorption performance can vary depending on temperature, constant temperature is the basic requirement during biosorption.	positive
The Langmuir model is the most commonly used one in practice, because it contains two useful and easily imaginable parameters (Qmax and KL), which are easy to understand because they reflect two important characteristics of the sorption system.	positive
Untreated crude biosorbents usually have a lower sorption capacity for metal ions than, for example, chemically modified biosorbents, because their surface lacks suitable chemical functional groups.	positive

Daemi and Barikani (2012) had previously reported that the absorption regions of O–H group in calcium alginate were narrower than the normal peak of sodium alginate, because the calcium ion decreased in hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl functional groups, resulting in narrower bands of calcium alginate [30].	positive
(2) Intermediate water is more weakly bound to the macromolecules than bound water and consequently has higher mobility and is freezable, albeit at temperatures below 0 °C.	positive
Theoretically, there will always be a concentration difference between hydrogels and the medium because the surrounding water can be defined as infinite in magnitude.	positive
It has been demonstrated that β-glucans must be administered orally because intravenously administered glucans are rapidly scavenged by CR3 blood granulocytes and liver Kupffer cells, and only a small amount of glucans reaches the tissue macrophages that could migrate into tumors [154].	positive
Unpurified LNPs dry powder has bright brown coloration because it contains natural impurities such as fatty acids, waxes, lipids, and tannins.	positive
Other TumorsH2S produced by bacteria freely enters the cells because of its lipophilicity and small size [133].	positive
Finally, because miR-615-3p is known to repress LCOR in macrophages [87], its downregulation in severe BPD may result in high LCOR levels, which also contribute to decreased PPARG.	positive
Sodium azide, the first known SecA inhibitor [26] is not a usable antibacterial because it is non-selective and inhibits eukaryotic enzymes such as other ATPases [27].	positive
An increase in eNOS phosphorylation on serine 1177 could also be explained by an increase in the interaction between Akt1 and eNOS.	positive
In whole specimens, it is possible to differentiate D. dentex from the other species belonging to the same genera because it has caniniform teeth that are quite linear and quite high compared to the cogeneric D. barnardi and D. canariensis, where they are more robust and of a bigger diameter.	positive
Although the manufacturer’s irradiance value for the Bluephase PowerCure (3 s protocol) is 3050 mW/cm2, our measured value was around 2400 mW/cm2, which may be partially explained by the difference in measuring devices and the variance in diameter among the sensor and light curing tip.	positive
For the vascular and renal complications of diabetes, evidence for a protective role of kinins and B2R comes from the observation of aggravated diabetic nephropathy in several animal models sharing the absence of B2R activation secondary to either inactivation of the B2R gene or reduced bioavailability of endogenous kinins in tissue kallikrein knock-out mice [29] or mice expressing three copies of the ACE /kininaseII gene [83].	positive
A mixed ACE-neprilysin inhibitor, omapatrilat, has been designed and tested in clinical trials but eventually not approved for clinical use because of its poor tolerance with a high incidence of angioedema [65].	positive
This is not surprising given that most SNAREs rely on a hydrophobic core for SNARE complex formation and would explain why the S174D mutant, which introduces a negative charge, showed less SNARE interactions when compared to the S174A mutant.	positive
Acylcarnitines present very high bioavailability compared to L-carnitine because they have a better ability to cross the blood–brain barrier compared to L-carnitine.	positive
When fatty acid oxidation is disturbed, fats cannot be used, so glucose is used without regeneration in the cycle of gluconeogenesis because of pyruvate carboxylase inhibition, ketone bodies cannot be produced, glucose level (hypoglycemia) decreases, and brain functioning impairment with loss of consciousness can occur; therefore, lipids play pivotal roles in the development and function of the human brain and body by acting as regulatory molecules.	positive
Symptoms of disturbances in biosynthesis and excretion of carnitine occur because of energy shortages and the accumulation of fatty acids in some organs.	positive
The low concentrations of plasma carnitines in patients with SPCD are caused by excessive urinary carnitine excretion because of defective reversible absorption in renal tubules; therefore, the carnitine level in plasma and tissues (heart and skeletal muscles) may drop to below 10% of normal values.	positive
Secondary carnitine deficiency may result from defects in any enzyme participating in the mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids because excess fatty acids linked to carnitine are excreted into the urine as acylcarnitines.	positive
Therefore, with secondary carnitine deficiency, the free carnitine pool is shifted in the direction of acylcarnitines because carnitine is used to eliminate the acyl groups of the accumulated fatty acids resulting from the dysfunction of fatty acids mitochondrial metabolism.	positive
Supplementation with carnitine in secondary carnitine deficiency requires small carnitine doses because carnitine levels may be normalized quickly.	positive
Additionally, in neonates, endogenic carnitine synthesis is limited because of the immaturity of liver enzymes, particularly γ-butyrobetaine dioxygenase (BBD), and the immaturity of renal canaliculus, which decreases the kidney’s carnitine reabsorption ability [7].	positive
L-carnitine supplementation is necessary during the treatment of ASD children with valproic acid because L-carnitine supplementation decreases hyperammonemia in patients with encephalopathy induced by valproic acid.	positive
The GSH concentration in serum, as well as the brain of patients with ASD, is lower, but the ratio of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione is higher because of impaired GSH synthesis.	positive

Moreover, the importance of vegetation succession is low in cases when the effects of climate change in grassland species (such as D. hatagirea) are considered, because forest establishment in an area is a much slower process compared to the upward shift of a grassland herbaceous plant [69,70].	positive
The participants considered that the indication of clear and precise dosage regimen instructions for dermatological skin treatments are important because contributes to increase adherence and effectiveness of topical treatment and to minimize the adverse effects of topical medicines, in line with Yamaura [40] observations.	positive
Meanwhile, the temperature of a large objective lens was higher than that of a small objective lens, because the concentration of light was stronger when the magnification of the objective lens was increased.	positive
The loss of the structure and location of secretory organelles when parasites were treated with DHEA could be in concordance with the reduction in the invasion and the ability to escape the macrophage lysis, because both mechanisms depend on the secreted proteins from micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules.	positive
Therefore, plant phenolics are beneficial because they not only conserve the quality of plant-based food and food products but also reduce the risk of the development of some human disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases, arteriosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, cataract, disorders of cognitive function, and neurological diseases [1,2,3].	positive
Central nervous system (CNS) neurons are not able to regenerate in mammals, therefore, an effective neuroprotective strategy to protect or regenerate retinal neurons during disease progression is urgently needed.	positive
Iron is required by most bacterial pathogens for growth and survival, and is therefore essential during the establishment of host colonization and infection.	positive
Early treatment of femoral neck fracture by surgery is fundamental in elderly patients, because it reduces the risk of mortality and disability.	positive
Studies regarding femur fracture are often related to senior patients, especially females [1], who are commonly affected by osteoporosis [2] due to their bone fragility and are therefore more likely to suffer the aforementioned fracture.	positive
Solid-state light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have become increasingly popular because of their efficient conversion of electrical energy to light energy for indoor plant cultivation [3].	positive
Nano-montmorillonite is a type of layered silicate with a thickness of less than 10 nm and therefore has a very large value of aspect ratio.	positive
The precise antimicrobial mechanism of action of chitosan is yet to be fully understood; still, based on the literature, the most likely antimicrobial mechanisms of action of chitosan include the disruption of the cell wall and, consequently, an effect on the membrane’s permeability, inhibition of DNA replication, cell death, and bindings to the trace metal elements resulting in toxin production and microbial growth inhibition [63].	positive
The results of effective wound healing with BC-ZnO NPs-BDP nanocomposites can be explained by the synergistic effect of all nanocomposite components, which regulate oxygenation and microcirculation, reducing hypoxia and oxidative stress in a burn wound.	positive
Maxent (software) is widely used because of its excellent predictive performance.	positive
Particularly, the relevance of rat and mouse as pathological models for the human has become insecure because of the wide quantitative gulf between necessary daily carcinogenic exposure for rodents and surveyed average natural daily human intake data.	positive
In summary, the expression, axonal transport, signaling, and accessibility of opioid receptors on DRG neurons depends on receptor type and duration of injury, and these mechanisms apparently contribute to enhanced analgesia and/or antiinflammatory effects	positive
Alprazolam therapy can increase the oral bioavailability of lithium carbonate in bipolar patients with generalised anxiety, probably due to a decrease in gastro-intestinal symptoms.	positive
Interactions between alprazolam and antidepressants have been particularly studied, due to the high frequency of coadministration, and most second-generation antidepressants, such as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), have been tested for this purpose.	positive
Formation of the heart involves a wondrous and precisely orchestrated series of molecular and morphogenetic events, and even subtle perturbation of this process can have catastrophic consequences in the form of congenital heart disease (CHD).	positive
Functional redundancy between Nkx2.5 and other cardiac-expressed homeobox genes in vertebrates is suggested by the ability of dominant-negative versions of Nkx2.5 to block cardiogenesis in frog and zebrafish embryos6,7.	positive
 In all vertebrates, the linear heart tube undergoes rightward looping, which is essential for proper orientation of the pulmonary (right) and systemic (left) ventricles, and for alignment of the heart chambers with the vasculature. 	positive
The molecular mechanisms governing cardiac looping remain unknown, but identification of genes differentially expressed along the outer and inner curvatures of the looped heart tube suggests that intrinsic properties of the two surfaces may underlie this critical morphogenetic event.	positive
The common association of human cardiac alignment defects with abnormalities in left–right asymmetry points to intersecting pathways that regulate the direction and process of cardiac looping, and highlights the clinical significance of this area of study.	positive
Early in development, septation of the cardiac tube into distinct chambers is achieved through regional swellings of extracellular matrix, known as cardiac cushions, that form the anlage of atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial valves (Fig. 1).	positive
Disruption of the Forkhead transcription factor Mfh1 causes hypoplasia of the fourth aortic arch artery in mice, resulting in absence of the transverse aortic arch37. 	positive
The incidence of sudden death is higher in men than women, largely because women are protected from coronary heart disease during the premenopausal years.	positive
The distinction between natural and accidental iatrogenic deaths may be difficult and somewhat arbitrary, but generally the death is considered natural if the procedure carries a significant risk of a fatal complication, and the condition is life threatening.	positive
The proportion of deaths from ischemic heart disease that are sudden declines with advancing age, because older patients are more likely to die of complications of heart failure, rather than ventricular arrhythmias.	positive
Abstinence from methamphetamines is the bedrock of reversibility, for in animal studies, even rats with advanced changes of cardiac remodelling such as myolysis, fibrosis and vacuolation demonstrated myocardial recovery upon cessation of methamphetamines [9].	positive
For patients with a significant history of methamphetamine abuse, it is reasonable to perform a 12-lead ECG to screen for cardiac complications based on the quoted 54% prevalence of cardiovascular disease in cases of methamphetamine abuse.	positive
In fact, bioinformatic analysis predicts that each miRNA may regulate hundreds of targets, suggesting that miRNAs may play a role in almost every biological pathway [6].	positive

For instance Hashimoto et al.[44] showed that 8-OHdG accumulates in rat kidney DNA with age.	negative
This has been observed in several cases of accelerated aging and may occur in normal aging too.[47]	negative
In addition to these three conditions, several other human syndromes, that also have defective DNA repair, show several features of premature aging.	negative

Circadian rhythms can refer to any process that originates within an organism (i.e., endogenous) and responds to the environment (is entrained by the environment).	negative
"While there are multiple mentions of ""natural body cycle"" in Eastern and Native American cultures, the earliest recorded Western account of a circadian process is credited to Theophrastus, dating from the 4th century BC, probably provided to him by report of Androsthenes, a ship's captain serving under Alexander the Great."	negative
"Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer identified the first clock mutation in Drosophila in 1971, naming the gene ""period"" (per) gene, the first discovered genetic determinant of behavioral rhythmicity.[20]"	negative
At the same time, Michael W. Young's team reported similar effects of per, and that the gene covers 7.1-kilobase (kb) interval on the X chromosome and encodes a 4.5-kb poly(A)+ RNA.[23][24]	negative
"The external stimulus used to entrain a rhythm is called the zeitgeber, or ""time giver""."	negative
Recent studies instead highlight the importance of co-evolution of redox proteins with circadian oscillators in all three domains of life following the Great Oxidation Event approximately 2.3 billion years ago.	negative
However, it is not clear whether there is a strong association between clock gene polymorphisms in humans and the susceptibility to develop the metabolic syndrome.	negative
In one study of reindeer, animals at 70 degrees North showed circadian rhythms in the autumn, winter and spring, but not in the summer.	negative
These rhythms are endogenously generated, self-sustaining and are relatively constant over a range of ambient temperatures. Important features include two interacting transcription-translation feedback loops: proteins containing PAS domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions; and several photoreceptors that fine-tune the clock to different light conditions.	negative
The central oscillator generates a self-sustaining rhythm and is driven by two interacting feedback loops that are active at different times of day.	negative
Therapeutic approaches primarily aim to manage symptoms, reduce immune system activity, and maintain the body's ability to fight diseases.	negative
The initial recognition of autoimmune diseases dates back to the early 1900s, and since then, advancements in understanding and management of these conditions have been substantial, though much more is needed to fully unravel their complex etiology and pathophysiology.[10]	negative
An individual may simultaneously have more than one autoimmune disease (known as polyautoimmunity), further complicating the symptomatology.	negative
A 2015 US survey found that 98% of people with autoimmune diseases experienced fatigue, 89% said it was a “major issue”, 68% said “fatigue is anything but normal. It is profound and prevents [them] from doing the simplest everyday tasks.” and 59% said it was “probably the most debilitating symptom of having an AD.”	negative
The impacts of these diseases can range from localized damage to certain tissues, alteration in organ growth and function, to more systemic effects when multiple tissues throughout the body are affected.	negative
The appearance of these signs and symptoms can not only provide clues for the diagnosis of an autoimmune condition, often in conjunction with tests for specific biological markers, but also help monitor disease progression and response to treatment.	negative
Coeliac disease is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.	negative

Some individuals with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis, which causes joint pain, stiffness, and swelling.	negative
B cells produce antibody molecules which may be either secreted or inserted into the plasma membrane where they serve as a part of B-cell receptors.	negative
To complete development, immature B cells migrate from the bone marrow into the spleen as transitional B cells, passing through two transitional stages: T1 and T2.	negative
They are named as such because they are unable to induce a humoral response in organisms that lack T cells.	negative
The second step consists of activated B cells entering a lymphoid follicle and forming a germinal center (GC), which is a specialized microenvironment where B cells undergo extensive proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, and affinity maturation directed by somatic hypermutation.	negative
B cells activated by TI antigens go on to proliferate outside lymphoid follicles but still in SLOs (GCs do not form), possibly undergo immunoglobulin class switching, and differentiate into short-lived plasmablasts that produce early, weak antibodies mostly of class IgM, but also some populations of long-lived plasma cells.	negative
There is evidence that B cells first differentiate into a plasmablast-like cell, then differentiate into a plasma cell.	negative
No common Breg cell identity has been described and many Breg cell subsets sharing regulatory functions have been found in both mice and humans.	negative
Abnormal B cells may be relatively large and some diseases include this in their names, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and intravascular large B-cell lymphoma.	negative
