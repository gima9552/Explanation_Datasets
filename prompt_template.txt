    - "Forcing mice to run using an electric shock likely introduces biases in the results due to stress induced in the animals."

- **Mechanistic Causation**: Details the specific processes or mechanisms through which a cause leads to an effect.
  - *Example Sentences*:
    - "Because sorption processes tend to be exothermic, maintaining a constant temperature is crucial during biosorption."
    - "Daemi and Barikani (2012) reported that absorption regions of O–H group in calcium alginate are narrower due to decreased hydrogen bonding."
    - "It has been demonstrated that β-glucans must be administered orally because intravenously administered glucans are rapidly scavenged by blood granulocytes."

- **Contrastive Explanation**: Compares scenarios to highlight why an outcome occurred in one instance and not in another.

- **Correlation**: Describes relationships between variables without establishing direct causality.
  - *Example Sentences*:
    - "One potential explanation for SCC initiation may be the accumulation of oncogenic mutations."
    - "An increase in eNOS phosphorylation could be explained by increased interaction between Akt1 and eNOS."
    - "A meta-regression concluded that improvements in BMD are strongly associated with reduction in fracture risk."

- **Pragmatic Approach**: Justifies actions based on practical considerations, emphasizing real-world applicability.
  - *Example Sentences*:
    - "Liquid formulations are most common in paediatrics due to their ease of administration."

- **No Explanation**: The sentence does not provide an explanation.
  - *Example Sentences*:
    - "The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in effect are deleterious to a cell's survival."
