introductionwhile cervical cancer screening methods ( i. e., the pap test and hpv test ) effectively prevent cervical cancer, they are not readily available to women in developing and underdeveloped countries.	positive
we next investigated whether hpv status correlated with pkm2 levels in cervical cancer cell lines as in clinical samples shown in figure 1b.	negative
knockdown of pkm2 did not affect e7 expression but resulted in a significant reduction in the cell number ( figure 3d ).	positive
it should be noted that 10 % of the total cytoplasmic fraction and 40 % of the entire nuclear fraction were analyzed with western blot ( i. e., the actual difference in the amount of pkm2 in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction is greater than what is shown in the figure ).	positive
however, it did not increase the nuclear localization of pkm2 ( figure 6b ).	negative
these results indicate that e7 - induced upregulation of pkm2 was not due to the inactivation of prb.	negative
intervening lanes were deleted and indicated by vertical lines.	negative
results from three independent experiments are shown as mean ± s. e. m.	negative
quantification results are shown in the right panel as mean ± s. e. m ( n = 3 ).	negative
the aim of the authors was to show how to use the collected data for scientific purposes, which is also an extension of their own research presented in [ 6 ], where the shm system of the redzinski bridge and measured quantities were described, but without statistical analysis.	negative
during the test loads, several different load schemes were used and compared with the model.	negative
the calculations ended when the stiffness and cable sag values had been stabilized. table 7 shows the described calculation results for the three longest stay cables.	negative
the outer cables are a little longer, because of the deck rotation to provide the transverse slope on the road surface.	positive
although the shm system is equipped with vibration sensors, these do not give accurate results as they record the measured values every 5 min.	positive
the presented approach aims to show only the maximum possible values of vibration accelerations, which supplement the data measured by the shm system.	negative
when the calculated and measured values start to differ significantly, this will indicate a possible failure of the facility and a quick decision may prevent a catastrophe. 5.	positive
histogram interpretationfigure 17a shows these histograms for the discussed cables.	negative
they were calculated on the basis of the separated diagrams shown in figure 16 and figure 17. the fatigue surface n ( σa, σm ) is calculated and described individually for each steel, just like the wohler curves [ 18 ].	negative
figure 19 shows the idea of such a simulation scheme. using data from the relevant months in the previous years, an empirical distribution of the stress change distribution can be created ( figure 20 ).	negative
first, monthly values were calculated and summed up over the following years. from the results in table 13, it is clear that the bridge was designed correctly, and the stay cables are not exposed to fatigue damage from changes in tensioning forces.	positive
local and rapid changes in the tension force are caused by the passage of heavy vehicles or by the overlapping effects of individual moving loads.	negative
for this purpose, it is worth creating an auxiliary fem model of the tested object to verify the measured data, which has been shown in this paper.	negative

this article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the creative commons attribution ( cc by ) license ( http : / / creativecommons. org / licenses / by / 4. 0 / ). magnesium - based batteries represent one of the successfully emerging electrochemical energy storage chemistries, mainly due to the high theoretical volumetric capacity of metallic magnesium ( i. e., 3833 mah cm−3 vs. 2046 mah cm−3 for lithium ), its low reduction potential ( −2. 37 v vs. she ), abundance in the earth ’ s crust ( 104 times higher than that of lithium ) and dendrite - free behaviour when used as an anode during cycling.	positive
fossil fuels must be replaced by clean energy sources, which does not involve greenhouse gas emissions, and a significant amount of attention is paid towards renewable energy solutions.	negative
it is, therefore, clear that, in order to reach a correct integration of renewables, a way to store energy when in excess and to use it when needed is necessary [ 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 ].	negative
unlike lithium [ 141, 142, 143, 144, 145 ], plating magnesium from organohalo - aluminate electrolyte does not involve dendrites formation.	negative
the gravimetric capacity theoretically achievable is also high, about 385 mah g−1, hypothesizing the transfer of six electrons and the formation of the alloy according to the following reaction [ 159 ] : 2bi + 3 mg2 + + 6 e− → mg3bi2 ( 1 ) an interesting superionic conductivity of magnesium ions in β - mg3bi2 has been shown [ 160 ].	negative
this was possibly due to a poor insertion kinetics of the tin anode, even though the coulombic efficiency seemed to increase with the charge – discharge rate.	positive
figure 10a schematically shows the increased grain boundaries and magnesium ions transport channels on the atomic scale that is possible to obtain after the first cycle in a dual - phase bismuth – tin electrode.	negative
galvanostatic discharge / charge profiles of the np - bismuth and alloy electrodes ( at a current density of 50 ma g−1 ) and of np - tin sample ( at 20 ma g−1 ) within the voltage range of 0 – 0. 8 v vs. mg2 + / mg ( figure 10e ) showed that np - bi6sn4 and np - bi4sn6 electrodes managed to deliver high values of discharge specific capacities equal to 434 and 482 mah g−1, respectively.	positive
although the investigated dual - phase bismuth – tin alloys cannot be considered as a definitive solution, they anyway indicate an important field of research that may lead to the development of an advanced electrode material in the future. future perspectives in this field could pass through two materials classes that are leading to noteworthy results in the energy storage field.	positive

by contrast, altruistic individuals and environmental ethics supporters will engage in pro - environmental behaviors when the benefits are personal and, critically, even if they are solely environmental ( passmore, 1974 ; de dominicis et al., 2017 ). it is worth noting, for ordinary people who are not involved in nimby activities, “ the impact of an individual ' s pro - environmental behavior on its own marginal welfare is rather negligible ” ( hartmann et al., 2017 : 44 ).	positive
our sub - hypotheses were as follows : h1a : altruism positively relates to environmental behaviors at the individual level. h1b : altruism positively relates to environmental behaviors at the organizational level. h1c : altruism positively relates to environmental behaviors at the policy level. environmental concerns and the second hypothesis : the assumption of a moral principlethe assumption of a moral principle, which suggests that environmental behaviors involve moral judgment, partly adheres to the kantian rule of the supreme principle of morality, that “ neither fear nor inclination to the law is the incentive which can give a moral worth to action ; only respect for it can do so ” ( kant, 1959, p. 440 ).	positive

in this regard, the volunteer participation could be categorized into the action at the “ organizational level. ” however, clearly, the notion of volunteering embodies a set of values, such as altruism that emphasize an action taken by personal choice and without expectation of pay ( dunn, 1995 ; xu, 2017 ).	positive
the descriptive statistics of the variables in this study are shown in table 2.	negative
however, as model a4 has shown, when the altruism variables were included, balance of nature dimension becomes non - significant, while the effect of other dimensions remains unchanged.	negative
the effect is still significant when adding environmental concern variables.	negative
young adults and middle - aged groups showed less participation in policy - level pro - environmental behaviors than the elderly group : for example, in model c1, the young adults and middle - aged groups had lower scores than elderly people by differences of 7. 37 and 7. 13, respectively.	positive
it can be seen that environmental concerns mainly affected individual and organizational pro - environmental participation, not policy participation.	negative
this is consistent with previous studies ( cai et al., 2018 ) and may be due to the fact that the cpc, as the ruling party, not only often asks members to play a leading / exemplary role in their work and in society, but also holds regular party meetings to disseminate certain policies and information.	positive
this may be due to the fact that social donations are the most easily - accessible environmental activities for people to participate in at the organizational level in mainland china. in summary, although it seems that the self - interested nimby movement is more likely to attract attention ( yang, 2005 ; li et al., 2012 ), our empirical research here shows that altruism and awareness of the ecological crisis can promote people ' s engagement in pro - environmental behaviors in china.	positive

lpp - deficient s. aureus strains exhibited smaller lesion size and reduced bacterial loads than their parental strains ; the altered phenotype in bacterial loads was tlr2 - independent.	positive
of note, the pace of infections caused by s. aureus is rapidly increasing and the emergence of antibiotic - resistant bacterial strains, such as methicillin - resistant s. aureus ( mrsa ) has severely reduced the available treatment options3, 6. during staphylococcal skin infection, microbe - associated molecular patterns ( mamps ) of s. aureus are recognized by pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ), leading to activation of the host defense system7.	positive
even with lower bacterial doses the sa113 parental strain gave rise to more severe skin lesions and tended to exhibit higher bacterial burden in contrast to its sa113δlgt mutant strain ( supplementary fig. 2 ).	positive
indeed, leukocyte depletion in mice with cyclophosphamide treatment fully abrogated the s. aureus lpp - induced effect in skin infection ( fig. 6 ).	positive
statistical evaluations were performed using the mann – whitney u test, with data expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean ( a, c ), or presented as scatterplot with line indicating median value ( b, d ).	negative
our data show that lpp - deficient s. aureus displayed less virulence and was more susceptible to immune killing than its parental strain in the skin infection model.	positive
the clinical outcome of an infection is, therefore, an overall result of these double effects induced by lpp.	negative
all these evidence suggest that lpp has some other unknown biological functions that contribute to the bacterial survival and persistence of skin infection. the importance of a balanced coagulation / fibrinolysis hemostasis in s. aureus infections has been shown before41.	positive
in particular, wnt signaling is associated with the determination of tooth number, shape, and hard tissue formation ; whereas cellular behavior, such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and migration of cells, is regulated by fgf, shh, and bmp signaling ( liu et al., 2008 ; balic and thesleff, 2015 ).	positive
functional studies conducted on different mirnas highlight their roles during tooth morphogenesis.	negative
during bud stage, the expression of mirna - 221 - 3p was restricted along the invaginated epithelium ( figure 1c ) with intense expression noted along the enamel knot ( ek ), iee, outer enamel epithelium ( oee ), and dental papilla ( dp ) at cap stage ( figure 1d ).	negative
*, * *, * * *, and * * * * indicate p < 0. 05, 0. 01, 0. 001, and 0. 0001, respectively.	negative
this suggests that bmp signaling would be indirectly affected when the levels of mirna - 221 - 3p are altered.	negative

older people with high social support also show greater adherence to healthier patterns of diet [ 18, 19 ] and physical activity [ 20 ], leading to a possible positive feedback loop between these three components.	positive
in order to minimize reverse causality, we first excluded 1307 individuals ( 38. 9 % ) with walking speed < 0. 8 meters per second ( m / s ) or five chair stands > 17 seconds ( s ) at baseline according to established cutoffs [ 24, 25 ] ( additional file 1 ).	negative
higher walking speed ( m / s ) and lower chair stands ( s ) scores indicate better mobility and strength, respectively.	positive
in addition, those with high levels in both adherence to md and physical activity showed the slowest decline in walking speed compared to the other groups, beyond the independent protective effect of both exposures ( β * time [ year ] = 0. 010, p = 0. 001 for high / high vs low / low categories ).	positive
the health, aging and body composition study ( health abc ) including a racially diverse sample from the us showed that over eight years of follow - up, older individuals aged > 70 years with a high adherence to md had significantly faster walking speed tests [ 33 ].	positive
furthermore, a high adherence to md has shown to reduce the rates of ischemic stroke and cardiovascular diseases by increasing hdl levels, promoting antioxidant effects and reducing inflammation and systemic hypoperfusion [ 47 ].	positive
in addition, other aspects of social well - being ( e. g., neighborhood social cohesion ) were not explored.	negative
killing was restricted to phagocytic host cells, and the former p. zopfii genotype 1 ( raised to p. ciferrii [ 1 ] ) could not kill these cells, suggesting that specific host - directed toxin ( s ) may be important for the virulence of p. bovis. one possibility is that, rather than bespoke virulence factors, prototheca may exploit environmental adaptations for “ accidental virulence, ” as has been proposed for other eukaryotic pathogens [ 23 ].	positive
this article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the creative commons attribution ( cc by ) license ( https : / / creativecommons. org / licenses / by / 4. 0 / ). nasal polyps ( nps ) are benign inflammatory masses causing chronic nasal obstruction, usually associated with underlying chronic rhinosinusitis ( crs ), which are rarely reported in childhood.	negative
nasal polyps : definition, epidemiology, and diagnostic approachnps are benign inflammatory single or multiple masses potentially arising from any portion of the mucosa of the nose and paranasal sinuses, causing chronic nasal obstruction [ 4, 5 ].	positive
in adults, an altered sense of smell and taste is also commonly reported, while in children, such disorders cannot always be assessed due to both the limited feasibility of available diagnostic tools and the delayed awareness of olfactory impairment [ 14, 15 ].	positive
many studies have shown that in most cases of pediatric crs, it is possible to isolate the same bacterial colonies from swabs taken from the crypts of the adenoids and from the lateral wall of the nose ( mostly staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and group a streptococci ) [ 32, 33, 34 ].	negative
currently, three different types of inflammatory patterns have been detected in adults with crs : ( i ) type 1 inflammation, originally directed toward intracellular pathogens, is characterized by a predominance of ifn - γ and tnf - alpha secretion ; ( ii ) type 2 inflammation, targeting extracellular parasites, is characterized by a predominance of il - 4, il - 5, and il - 13 secretion ; and ( iii ) type 3 inflammation, targeting extracellular bacteria and fungi, is dominated by il - 22 and il - 17 secretion.	negative
however, while the link between ar and asthma has been elucidated, reporting that about 40 % of patients with ar have concomitant asthma and that 30 – 80 % of asthmatics have ar, the same is not true for ar and crs.	positive

treatment of nasal polyps : the new era of biological agentsappropriate medical therapy with nasal irrigation with saline and intranasal corticosteroids is the first - line medical treatment both in pediatric and adult crs with or without nps [ 1, 82 ], while antibiotics and systemic steroids are used only in case of exacerbation ; there is a lack of supportive evidence for prolonged macrolide therapy in children with crs [ 1 ].	positive
activation of the complement system by alta was also confirmed by the increase of c9 deposition on the bacterial cell surface ( figure 7b ), and alta - mediated c9 deposition increased the bactericidal effects ( figure 7c ).	positive
however, these results are not consistent with our previous study using s. aureus - injected mice.	negative
when s. aureus enters the body, it inhibits the activity of the complement system, and when toxins such as s. aureus lta are injected, tissue damage due to excessive complement activity may occur. the negative regulation of tlr signaling is a very important cellular event to maintain homeostasis of the immune system [ 21 ].	positive
for example, alta inhibits lps - induced b cell proliferation in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models, but the effect was not observed in the splenocytes from tlr2 - deficient mice, suggesting that tlr2 is involved in alta - mediated signaling [ 30 ].	positive

the national kala - azar elimination program focuses mainly on early diagnosis and complete treatment, improved case management, effective disease and vector surveillance, social mobilization and partnership, and integrated vector control. until recently, vl was thought to be the major clinical form of leishmania infection in nepal.	positive
these emerging cl cannot be simply overlooked, though more research needs to be carried out to confirm the potential sources of cl, including the molecular profiling of leishmania species in both patients and vectors from cl reported areas.	negative
we believe that through this base - line information, we will be able to recommend the control and elimination program on specific improvements ( additional information ) in the online surveillance system based on the existing scenarios and recommend further operational research on cl in the country. conclusionsthis study has highlighted the issue of an important neglected disease and it is expected that it will draw the attention of the policy makers to formulate protocol for the effective surveillance, management and control of leishmaniasis.	positive

an in - depth knowledge of the control of the synergistic effects between melatonin and exosomes offers a valuable therapeutic promise for the treatment of several diseases. exosome - melatonin therapy protects against ischemia - reperfusion injuryhepatic ischemia - reperfusion ( i / r ) injury is a major complication of liver tissue often observed during liver surgery ( e. g., liver resection, trauma, and liver transplantation ) with pro - inflammatory components and immune cells being important players.	positive
in addition, they demonstrated that exosomes isolated from vsmcs or calcified vascular smooth muscle cells ( cvsmcs ), treated with melatonin, can be absorbed by vsmcs and attenuate osteogenic differentiation and senescence of vsmcs or cvsmcs, respectively.	positive
melatonin was able to effectively promote the secretion of exosomes from adipocytes, increasing the level of exosomal αkg derived from adipose tissue.	positive
moreover, melatonin - exosome therapy could fight most of these disease processes by preventing their progression, not only their clinical manifestations.	positive
after different incubation times, the reactions were quenched by adding 5, 5 ′ - dithiobis ( 2 - nitrobenzoic acid ) ( dtnb, ellman´s reagent ) [ 39, 40 ] ( 1 : 1 ratio with respect to the initial concentration of gsh ).	negative
the effect of the mutation on the activity of the inhibitors was assessed by the visualization of the subcellular localization of the xpo1 cargo ranbp1.	negative
indeed, such ethers ( compounds 33 and 34 ) also showed xpo1 inhibition, but did not improve the inhibitory value of compound 10. 3.	negative

this is mainly evident in developed mediterranean countries with a long - lasting tradition on dairy sheep farming, and a well - organized sheep milk processing industry ( e. g., greece, spain, france, italy, etc.	negative
additionally, hoof conformation and hoof keratin quality are fundamental to maintain the foot health status [ 16 ], however, selective breeding for these traits has not been extensively applied.	positive
hence, foot - related lameness cannot be evaluated and prioritized on ad hoc basis and subsequently, the suggestion of lameness mitigation strategies is not possible in intensive dairy sheep farms, although an urgent need to cope with the problem is evident. to address the aforementioned research gap, the objectives of this cross - sectional study were ( i ) to investigate and describe the epizootiology of lameness - related foot diseases and lesions, and ( ii ) to assess the impact of potential risk factors on them, in intensive dairy sheep farms in greece. 2.	positive
however, the kaiser – meyer – olkin measure of sampling adequacy was low ( 0. 338 ) and bartlett ’ s test of sphericity was not significant ( p = 0. 186 ), indicating a poor performance of the pca ; thus, the extracted pcs were not used for the subsequent clustering of the farms.	positive
this is a hypothesis supported by studies in dairy cows showing that high yielding animals are more likely to develop foot lesions and lameness [ 23, 28, 29 ] ; however, this is not sufficiently evidenced in dairy sheep [ 11 ], and under the current study - design, it is not possible neither to conclude the pathophysiological mechanisms nor estimate the effect of milk yield on foot - related lameness.	positive
high prevalence of wld is not unusual.	negative
[ 30 ] reported white line lesions ( wld and wla ) as the second most significant cause of foot - related lameness in intensively reared chios sheep ( with an incidence risk of 1. 1 % and 0. 8 %, respectively ) ; however, only lame animals were included in that study.	negative
poor wool quality could be linked to a higher prevalence of hoof wall cracks, due to the fact that keratin of both wool and hoof horn have similar low - and high - sulfur protein fractions [ 67, 68, 69 ] ; however, this was not confirmed by the model applied in our study.	positive
animals usually walk on soft straw bedding material which does not favor natural wearing of the hoof.	negative

introductionthe construction of structures involving concrete underwater placement usually require additional considerations due to its unique circumstances.	positive
for 28 days strength, it also showed an increment about 10 % compared to specimen produced with fresh water but it induced corrosion on the rebars [ 9 ]. meanwhile for the placement method, the concreting process can be made using tremie pipe for mass concrete.	negative
from the underwater placement of aafa paste, there is washout effect with the increment in the surrounding water ’ s ph value.	positive
for practical application, it is suggested to use the retarding admixture to control the setting time, as it can delay the setting time and keep the aafa concrete workable throughout the placing process. 3. 3.	positive
meanwhile the content of al2o3 showed a reduction in aafa paste relative to the raw fly ash.	negative
from the three different spots, the ca and si are predominant indicating the existing of calcium silicate hydrate ( c - s - h ). the microstructure of specimens cast in lake water ( figure 9a ) showed micro - crack and it is believed to be due to sample preparation for fesem.	positive
conclusionsthe use of concrete for underwater placement is a significant challenge due to washout effect as well as the presence of various ions in the water which can influence the properties of concrete.	positive
children are especially vulnerable to different inorganic elements since their detoxification mechanisms are not fully developed and their organs are in formation [ 4 ].	positive
results and discussionthe descriptive statistics of the heavy metal and trace element levels found in the breast milk samples are shown in table 3.	positive
relationship between levels of inorganic pollutants and characteristics of mothersthe relationships between the heavy metals and trace elements studied and the most significant characteristics of mothers are shown in table 4. the highest levels of aluminum, nickel, selenium, arsenic, lead, zinc and mercury in breast milk were found in women residing in the industrial and mining zone, which may be due to the fact that the study area is strongly affected by these anthropogenic activities, which make it the zone containing the most severely metal - contaminated sediments in the mediterranean area [ 66, 67 ].	positive
maternal diet and habitsthe relationships between the heavy metals and trace elements studied and the most significant diet and habits of mothers are shown in table 4.	positive
the mann - whitney u - test showed that lead and manganese levels are significantly higher in non - vegetarian women. despite the fact that fish intake is considered the main source of mercury of non - labor origin, we did not find significant differences in the levels of mercury in the milk of women with high consumption of fish in general, shellfish or tuna ( p = 0. 539 ).	positive
arsenic concentration showed a significant negative correlation with birth weight in our study ( rs = −0. 392 ; p = 0. 005 ).	negative
cadmium and copper levels were higher in the milk of mothers of children with lower current weight ; in turn, arsenic levels were higher in the milk of women with children of a lower birth weight, which would confirm that exposure to high concentrations of certain toxic substances is associated with low infant weight. diet significantly influences the levels of certain elements in breast milk — for example, the amount of water consumed by the mother was associated with higher concentrations of aluminum and lead ; vegetarian diets were associated with higher levels of lead, arsenic, cadmium and manganese ; and high consumption of fruit was associated with an increase in copper concentrations.	positive
we will also compare the significance of different eeg channel subsets for emotion recognition and present the relevance of different subsets of eeg channels to emotion recognition. 2.	negative
it has 3 - by - 3 kernels throughout its convolutional path, except for the very first convolutional layer ( conv 0 ) which has 7 - by - 7 kernels. the color coding of figure 3 denotes the major convolutional blocks of the resnet.	negative
comparing the rudimentary eeg signal sampling point by sampling point across the channels may have considerably taken into account the undesired meaningless voltage variations, resulting in lower classification accuracy in the resnet18 - 1d - ( s - t - alternate ) model. we have also constructed and examined another variant of the resnet18 - 1d - ( s - then - t ) model with its several initial convolutional layers all being spatial - dimension convolution followed by temporal convolution only.	positive
electrode distance to the midlinewith reference to figures 5 ( a ) and 5 ( b ), the relevance of different subsets of eeg channels for emotion recognition is investigated, with respect to the channels ' distance from the midline. the trend of classification accuracy as reported in figure 5 follows that the more laterally placed the eeg channels are, the higher the classification accuracy they deliver.	positive
using the seed dataset, our best performing model [ resnet18 - 1d - ( t - then - s ) ] has achieved a 3 - class emotion classification accuracy of 93. 42 %. not of less importance, the batch normalization function proves to be essential in tackling the problem of internal covariate shift which can result in model optimization convergence failure. investigating the eeg channel significance for emotion recognition from the neurological aspects, the laterally placed channels around the temporal lobe show greater importance than the channels placed over other brain regions.	positive
by bw, the simple linear regression similarly showed a strong relationship between the de and me for hanwoo above and below 350 kg bw : me = 0. 9833 × de − 0. 2760 ( r2 = 0. 991, rmse = 0. 055, p < 0. 001 for the intercept and slope ) and me = 0. 72975 × de + 0. 38744 ( r2 = 0. 913, rmse = 0. 100, p < 0. 001 for the intercept and slope ), respectively.	positive
[ 10 ] estimated the me : de of hanwoo steers weighing 376. 6 and fed rice straw ( 44 % ) and concentrate ( 56 % ) at three different energy levels ( 0. 8, 1. 2 and 1. 6 times the maintenance ), and the me : de ranged between 83 % and 90 %.	negative
the data included individual treatments from three different studies published in korean journals and national reports from 1983 to 2013.	negative
to estimate the ndf, adf and ee for the studies that did not provide these data, tabular values for the feed ingredients reported by the korean feeding standards [ 3 ] were used to assume the ingredient composition information presented in this paper.	negative
in addition, the me showed strong positive correlations with the de, ee and cp dietary contents.	negative
nonetheless, methane and urinary energy seem not to be appropriate explanations for mature hanwoo in the fattening phase being fed high - concentrate - based diets with a percentage of inclusion that ranged from 70 % to 90 %.	negative
evn neurons were confirmed as cholinergic by double - labeling with antibodies against eyfp ( chr2 ) and choline acetyltransferase ( chat ), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of acetylcholine.	negative
arrow points to gfp but not fg - positive evn neuron.	negative
a significant result indicated that the distribution of fg - positive cells constituted a separate population from those that were fg - negative. resultsthe central efferent vestibular system ( evs ) we used a chat - chr2 mouse line ( n = 5 ; two males and three females ) to explore the precise location and co - ordinates of the evn nucleus.	positive
our results suggested only one evn population or cluster on each side of the brainstem in mice and this was confirmed by our retrograde labeling results ( see below ).	negative
in addition, antibody labeling confirmed the simultaneous presence of chat and therefore the cholinergic identity of these neurons ( figures 3f – k ).	negative
note, the evn ( figures 6e, f ), is clearly distinguished from the closest group of gfp - labeled cell bodies in the cholinergic abducens nucleus, located ventral to the facial nerve genu ( figure 6d ). prior to the use of fg as a retrograde tracer, we injected fast green dye into the pc to confirm the spread from the pc to the rest of the vestibular portion of the membranous labyrinth ( figure 6a ).	positive
we observed contralateral bound axons crossing the midline of the brainstem, approximately 100 μm more rostral to the level of the evn neurons, suggesting a rostral - looping trajectory of the contralaterally projecting fibers before they turned back caudally to join ventrally projecting ipsilateral evn fibers, as they exited towards the eighth nerve.	positive

recent studies have shown that cytokines play an important role in acute encephalopathy [ 3, 4, 5 ].	positive
patients with influenza a / h1n1 infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome / acute kidney injury have an overproduction of mcp - 1, vegf, and ip - 10, possibly contributing to kidney injury, and are reported to be associated with a higher risk of death [ 20 ]. the enhanced viral clearance and promotion of host recovery by il - 12 treatment has been described along with its implications in the treatment of human encephalitis [ 21 ].	positive
anti - il - 12 treatments and other therapies available for patients in the early stages of disease are hence expected to be effective for curing encephalopathy, as well as for alleviating the associated sequalae. a limitation of this study is that the sample size of patients with encephalopathy caused by virus was too small to demonstrate statistically significant data to support our conclusion, particularly regarding the effects on outcome. author contributionsh. k.	positive
before the era of tyrosine - kinase inhibitors ( tkis ), pediatric ph + all showed a worse prognosis in comparison to other forms of all, and was managed with intensive chemotherapy, followed, whenever possible, by allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) in first morphological complete remission.	positive
this is because it comes from different breakpoints on chromosome 22 in the bcr gene and encodes for three principal isoforms of aberrant protein kinases ( namely, p190, p210, and p230 ) with distinct molecular mass ( 20 ).	positive
however, given the effectiveness of tkis in controlling the disease, bcr - abl1 is potentially the major drive responsible for the abnormal proliferation of leukemia blasts in ph + all.	positive
acting as a multiple protein kinases inhibitor and not only a bcr - abl - directed molecule, dasatinib can offer multiple pharmacodynamic antineoplastic effects.	positive
this combination was safe and effective ( in terms of 3 - year efs ) in pediatric ph + all patients, with 14 % who underwent hsct in cr1, versus 80 % in the esphall trial. total xvi studyjeha et al.	positive
future studies addressing the same issue in a pediatric population are needed, although some clinical experiences support the positive role of the drug in this clinical setting ( 57 ). dasatinib as a bridge to the second allograft in post hsct relapsed ph + alla case report showed a ph + all patient with early relapse after first hsct, who was given dasatinib single agent treatment, achieving complete molecular remission, which persisted for 12 months after the second hsct, with acceptable tolerability ( 58 ). another clinical case explored dasatinib in early relapsed ph + all post hsct.	positive
for this reason, it is still necessary to confirm the replicability of such results and further verify the many beneficial effects that have been attributed to ( a ) xos consumption.	negative
the same observed phenomenon happened in another study, at the dose of 10 g xos per day [ 88 ].	negative
since ( a ) xos with greater effects are the ones with low dp [ 42, 65 ], a further treatment could be necessary, for example with acids or enzymes [ 102 ].	negative
in fact, they have an influence on the solubility of xos and their prebiotic effect [ 62 ] and therefore the sensibility of different functional groups to autohydrolysis must also be assessed.	positive
enzymatic treatmentanother potentially green and functional extraction method is the one that involves the use of enzymes on hs.	positive
many enzymatic tests have been performed on different raw materials, such as corncobs [ 77, 119 ], almond shell [ 114 ], oil palm frond fibres [ 120 ], and wheat bran [ 108 ], with variable ( a ) xos yields and variable dp, although most obtained xos had a good percentage of dp 2 – 4.	negative

this paper obtained the combined conversion probability of land - use type k in grid unit p at time t by calculating the probability of occurrence, land - use conversion inertia, neighborhood effect, and land - use conversion cost.	positive
the reduction in soc and agc was still the main type of carbon storage loss. figure 8 indicates the spatial distribution of carbon storage loss in yrd from 2000 to 2035.	positive
by contrast, the small and medium - sized cities ’ carbon losses may be alleviated considering the relatively weak economic foundation and low population inflow, such as anqing city and chizhou city.	positive
the major conclusions are as follows : ( 1 ) from the simulations, compared with 2000 – 2020, the loss of future carbon storage will be effectively controlled, but it is still in a state of depletion.	negative

the reasons for the abovementioned difference among samples are strictly linked to the fact that the control sample becomes unacceptable because of the degradation of the whole product, whereas the active samples were mainly refused for the turbidity of the syrup in the containers, which negatively affected the visual quality of the fruit salad.	positive
further studies are needed to solve the problem of suspended powder in fructose syrup because this flaw can make the product unattractive.	positive

while the isotropic spherical pores ( l / d = 1 ) showed no deformation or orientation after the shaping and sintering process, a pronounced orientation of the tubular pores generated by the anisotropic pyrolyzed cellulose fibers ( l / d = 19 ) was observed.	positive
in particular, it can be seen that the samples with spheres ( regardless of proportion and size ) are close to each other and the fiber sample deviates from them due to the different microstructure and connectivity.	positive
this is also confirmed by the evaluation of the derivations.	negative
due to the high scatter of the individual distributions ( not shown here ), consolidation only occurs from a voi of 400 × 400 px and above.	positive
the addition of spheres of different diameters then leads to the formation of hotspots within the pore network, depending on the concentration and diameter, as shown un figure 7b.	positive
in contrast, a significant increase of the permeability could be obtained for the bimodal samples combining the interconnected pore network of the pyrolyzed cellulose fibers with additional spherical pores for an improved flow - rate.	positive
both flexural strength and stiffness were mainly influenced by the type and size of the templates since the experimental data could not be well described by single overall curve fits ( dash - dot black line with 90 % confidence interval, figure 9 ).	positive
for the fitted λ0 = 27. 2 wm−1k−1, an acceptable fit of equation ( 2 ) ( r2 = 0. 919 ) shows that corresponding to the mechanical properties, the thermal conductivity was not only dependent on the total porosity but was mainly influenced by the type, volume fractions and orientation of the sacrificial templates.	positive

high - throughput platforms could accelerate work in this field, and also could be used to engineer de novo histone affinity reagents ; yet, published studies on their use with histones have been noticeably sparse.	positive
these results suggest that immobilization density alone cannot fully explain the degraded performance of peptide - labeled beads. 2. 5.	negative
this is further exacerbated by the fact that affinity reagents for histone ptms must discriminate between differentially modified forms of the same amino acid ( h3k9, h3k9me1, h3k9me2, h3k9me3, h3k9ac ) where the difference can often be just a few atoms.	positive

to estimate the genetic trends using pblup and ssgblup, the ( g ) ebv for a given trait were averaged by year of birth for animals with both phenotypes and genotypes.	positive
the percentage of individuals born from 2015 to 2020 that were genotyped ranged from 5 to 21 %.	negative
overall, the changes of prediction accuracies over time may not follow the genetic trends estimated by pblup or ssgblup. although investigating the fluctuations in the genetic trend across time for each trait is beyond the scope of this study, the changes in genetic trends observed are consistent with the breeding practices and the periodic modifications of weights in the selection index and the genetic correlations between traits under selection.	positive
genetic evaluation using pblup assumes that rms average 0, but when genotyped animals with positive or negative rms receive phenotypes or progeny, the average rms is no longer 0 [ 7, 9 ].	positive

another enzyme, o - glcnacase ( oga ), removes o - glcnac from proteins [ 4, 5 ].	negative
results showed that the half - life of ogt protein in tmg - treated cells was similar to that in vehicle - treated control cells ( figure 3c ).	negative
interestingly, when investigating the transcriptional control of the oga promoter using luciferase reporter assays, we did not obtain results consistent with the effects on oga protein levels, indicating that there is some other regulatory mechanism involved in modulating the oga transcript in response to o - glcnac levels. many studies have demonstrated that o - glcnacylation participates in epigenetics by modifying histone proteins, including h2a, h2b, h3 and h4 [ 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 ].	positive
as these seemingly discrepant findings for the mechanisms of ogt regulation were obtained in different types of cells, it remains to be clarified whether ogt expression is regulated in a cell - type - specific manner.	positive
however, our results did not show changes of ogt protein stability by tmg treatment.	negative
by mutating these two sites and showing that the s5a / s6a 4e - bp1 mutant protein no longer supports the hyper - o - glcnacylation - induced downregulation of ogt protein level like the wild - type 4e - bp1 protein does, we provide evidence supporting a scenario in which the o - glcnacylation of proteins regulating translation may represent one key mechanism in mediating the compensatory modulation of ogt expression for maintaining o - glcnac homeostasis in lung cancer cells.	positive

fluorescence photomicrographs acquired for illustration purposes were occasionally adjusted for contrast, brightness, and intensity. overlays were made ( corel photo - pain x8 ) from images of cresyl violet - stained sections alongside images of the corresponding fluorescence sections ( with retrograde - labeled cells and / or parvalbumin stain ).	positive
nissl - stained section from the same case ( # 9 ) is shown, with the sublaminar borders indicated by asterisks as in f. this brain section is adjacent to the section in e and f, and the indicated laminar borders in this case were made by overlaying the image with the cresyl violet - stained image.	negative
in contrast, layer via is more clearly labeled.	negative
in all zoom panels, the first image to the left shows fast blue - labeled cells, the second shows ctb - labeled cells, and the third image is an overlay of the two previous images.	negative
there was, however, a particular lightness of the layer v label in those cases when the tracer appeared completely restricted to re. ventral prefrontal corticesin general, re tracer injections labeled layer vib in medial cortical areas, with noticeably weaker labeling in layer via ( figs.	negative
labeled cells resulting from the fast blue tracer in nucleus reuniens are distributed across all septotemporal and proximodistal portions ( with a slight preference for distal portions at septal levels ), whereas the ctb label ( from the anteromedial thalamic nucleus ) shows a clear preference for the proximal subiculum and often avoids the most ventral subiculum, aside from the ventral portion of the intermediate subiculum ( c ).	negative

consequently, a systematic comparison between inputs to anterior and posterior nucleus reuniens was not possible. one general difference in the cortical afferents to the two thalamic sites concerns their dorsal / ventral and rostral / caudal origins, which were confirmed by quantitative analyses.	positive
one example concerns the relative distributions of “ short ” versus “ tall ” pyramidal neurons across layers via and vib ( lund et al., 1979 ; briggs, 2010 ), which may then differentially innervate the two thalamic nuclei under investigation.	negative
it is striking that nucleus reuniens not only receives subcortical afferents from these same sites, but also receives additional projections from a wide array of other subcortical nuclei ( mckenna and vertes, 2004 ).	negative
to this pattern of potential segregation can be added previous evidence of an apparent lack of individual cells that project to both the mammillary bodies and nucleus reuniens ( mathiasen et al., 2019 ), as well as a lack of individual neurons that innervate more than one anterior thalamic nucleus ( wright et al., 2013 ) or innervate both the anterior thalamic nuclei and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus ( wright et al., 2013 ).	negative
the results show that the deepest sublayer ( vib ) of medial prefrontal cortex target re whereas the projection to atn originates from more superficial sublayers ( via ).	negative

time - temperature superposition principlethe time - temperature superposition principle is generally defined and applied by shifting experimental data along the logarithmic time or frequency axis, whereat one temperature is set as the basis or reference, and, due to the shift, the data range for the reference temperature will be extended in time or frequency range.	positive
as can be seen from figure 1b, one value of master time represents a projection of different values of real time for each corresponding temperature, for example, for τ ^ a in the form ( 7 ) τ ^ = 1α ( ) τ ^ aand ( 8 ) τ ^ = 1α ( ) τ ^ a = τ ^ aas a fundamental goal of tts, and depicted in figure 1c, the function f of the two independent variables τ and should be represented by only one reduced variable, as exemplarily the master time τ ^ in this work.	negative
in contrast, in the present work α ( ) is considered as a pure temperature - dependent function as for tts.	negative
in the following, correlations between the new introduced tte formulation and exemplarily chosen ttp ( larson – miller parameter and haque – stewart parameter ) are shown. 4. 1.	negative

the combination of all three of the critical aspects, i. e., thermal aging, creep, and thinning effects, was taken into consideration in order to verify the structural integrity of such an item. compared to study [ 8 ], in which the aging and thinning effects are analyzed for a simple straight pipe, the behavior of an elbow pipe along its longitudinal direction is the subject of this study ( complex geometry ). thinning is more severe in bent pipe sections and elbows and in any component whose geometry varies drastically or is more complex ; change in the direction of the flow makes an item susceptible to both erosion and corrosion damage [ 24 ].	positive
the effect of changes in the temperature distribution contributes to the deformation of the body through thermal strains and influences the material properties.	positive

in addition to nschd, tbx5 and tbx20 were shown by this technique to cause chd with malformations of other organ systems [ 22, 23 ]. during the early 2000s, the development of array comparative genomic hybridization enabled high - resolution genome - wide screening for copy number variants ( cnvs ) [ 24 ].	negative
this is because severe chd reduces reproductive fitness and has a relatively low sibling recurrence risk.	positive
by mitigating the variant interpretation criteria, which were based on american college of medical genetics and genomics ( acmg ) guidelines and evaluation by a clinical geneticist, a genetic counselor and a cardiologist, to include variants that appeared plausible but did not meet the criteria for pathogenicity, the number of potentially relevant variants increased from 14 to 22 without decreasing the proportion of chd with extracardiac issues.	positive

it should, however, be kept in mind that phenotypic differences in the patient - derived hips - cms might also reflect differences in experimental design and success, as there are many distinct differentiation protocols, and it is well known that large variations in differentiation efficiency occur [ 79 ].	positive

it has been shown that multiple conductive materials such as biochar can be supplemented to anaerobic digesters to increase the rate of diet.	negative
the fact that ph values between 7. 5 and 8. 0 were maintained despite such high acid concentrations could be explained by an increased buffer capacity due to high nh4 - n contents ( fig. 1c ).	positive

biochar samples which were not inserted into the digesters did not show f420 - signals.	negative
the lower ratio of firmicutes in the biochar samples might indicate that bacteria within biochar particles are rather associated with secondary fermentation ( acetogenesis ) than with hydrolytic and acidogenic events.	positive
in this relation, it must be noted that the phylum chloroflexi showed a significant higher abundance in the biochar powder ( fdr adjusted p - value < 0. 05 ; deseq2 test ).	positive
the fact that limnochordia mba03 occurs both in the biochar particles and in the liquid phase could indicate that the biochar particles can also be used as conductive structures by microorganisms in the liquid phase.	positive
therefore, it could be possible that biochar particles increased the rate of diet during nitrogen metabolism, which in turn caused a shift from caldicoprobacter to proteiniphilum. although bacteria - specific primers were used ( as described in material and methods ), several archaea were recorded.	positive
the β - diversity is shown in a principal component analysis ( pcoa ) and indicates that the microbial communities of sludge samples and powdered biochar are substantially different from each other.	negative
for example, a recent study described that 5 different biochar types, which were evaluated as supplements for anaerobic digestion, retained fe, co, ni and mn [ 38 ].	negative

in a multiplex approach, where up to 40 antibodies are stained in parallel, different protocols may be unfeasible [ 6 ]. although existing instruments can theoretically measure more than 100 different channels, the multiplex application is currently still restricted to a few dozen due to limited availability of suitable isotopes [ 3, 6, 30 ].	positive
for the present post - hoc analysis, 79 patients were excluded due to a lack of information on renal function on admission or before discharge or a lack of follow - up data, leading to a final cohort of 944 patients. the study was conducted in adherence to the declaration of helsinki.	positive
even the use of very high amounts of cm ( ≥ 300 ml ) during coronary angiography showed no association with development of aki, irrespective of the aki definition applied ( or 0. 65 [ 95 % ci 0. 23 – 1. 9 ] for akin 1 ; or 0. 99 [ 95 % ci 0. 51 – 1. 92 ] for akin 2 ; or 0. 80 [ 95 % ci 0. 28 – 2. 28 ] for cin ; or 0. 79 [ 95 % ci 0. 42 – 1. 49 ] for rifle ).	positive
the latter patients might then be treated in a more cavalier fashion “ stepmotherly ” leading to a more equal distribution of aki between these groups. in conclusion, considering the current data, the role of contrast media in aki is controversial and can only be adequately addressed by randomized controlled studies.	positive
as the cm applied during that period was low - osmolar and is still available on the market, we assume that it was not more detrimental than the cm used currently in the hospital, which is also low - osmolar. conclusionour study demonstrates that development of aki, classified on the basis of four different aki definitions, is strongly associated with mid - term, all - cause mortality in a real - world acs cohort.	positive

recent studies confirm that expression of mir - 96 is dramatically decreased after sci, favoring induction of apoptosis due to increase in expression of its targets, which are pro - apoptotic proteins [ 59 ].	positive
studies on mir - 96, specifically its role in hepatocarcinogenesis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ), have shown that mir - 96 is significantly upregulated in hcc [ 67 ].	positive

in total, five studies ( oude hengel et al., 2012 ; dyrbye et al., 2016 ; verweij et al., 2016 ; coo and salanova, 2018 ; kuijpers et al., 2020 ) reported effects on at least one of the three sub - components of work engagement as measured by the uwes - scale ( schaufeli et al., 2006 ).	negative

specifically, the systematic review showed that 53 % of the 30 studies that measured work engagement as a higher - order construct reported an improvement.	negative
however, the sub - group difference between intervention foci in this analysis was not statistically significant.	negative
at the same time, it was rarely explained on what basis a tailored study approach was developed and it may be that a universal approach would have been at least equally effective in at least some of these studies.	negative
further, participants reported that they also experienced positive effects other than those intended in the program, such as developing additional resources.	negative
however, in order to nuance the information on the evidence identified, as well as to test the robustness of the findings from the meta - analysis exercise, we performed several sub - group analyses.	negative
first, robustness of study findings should be ensured in future bottom - up intervention studies investigating the effect on work engagement.	negative
however, based on the synthesized evidence, practitioners are guided to educate, facilitate, and encourage individual bottom - up approaches that promote the overall work engagement of employees. third, the evidence retrieved from the meta - analysis suggests that future intervention research should apply universal approaches rather than tailored ones.	positive

the work from the sobell lab provided the first experimental evidence of the intercalation of aromatic amino acridines and phenanthridinium molecules between dna bases.	negative
their test systems consisted of a 1 : 1 dna – ethidium complex, manually inserting the ethidium molecule in the intercalating site ( apa step ) with the ligand both from the major and minor grooves and three ethidium molecules inserted in three different base - steps separated by one drug - free site.	negative
visual examination of the trajectories confirms the long - lived presence of the ethidium ligands in two main configurations : stacked on the terminal base - pairs or intercalated at the terminal base - pair step.	negative
this could be due to the kinetics and enhanced thermal stability or simply this was not observed because the simulations were not long enough.	positive
remembering that we have a simulation with four free binders, ethidium ligand 2, for example, shows a clear intercalation event in the central base - pairs of the gaac duplex and ligands 1, 3 and 4 present a similar intercalation density close to the terminal base - pairs, noting that since the shown reference dna is an average structure without ethidium present, the dna shown does not have the characteristic dna deformations seen in previous studies of ethidium interaction with duplexes ( 45 ). figure 4.	positive
radial plot r shows similar molarity values of – 2. 5 at very close distance of the gaac helical axis ( intercalation and stacking events ) and higher values of. 5 – 3 molarity close to a value of 10 a which corresponds to the edge of the gaac duplex from the minor groove region. figure 5.	negative

similarly, the effects of a. muciniphila and its evs in hfd - fed mice revealed that this bacterium and its evs could ameliorate obesity by reducing the body weight gain, fat accumulation, and pathological abnormalities [ 14, 15, 22 ].	positive
during obesity, adipose tissue remodeling occurs, which causes adipocyte enlargement, extracellular matrix components accumulation, and infiltration of pro - inflammatory macrophages, thereby modulating adipose tissue remodeling could prevent obesity [ 36 ].	positive
our results, in line with our meta - analysis, showed that hfd changed the expression of fatty liver - related genes by upregulating ppar - γ, lpl, and tgf - β and downregulating angptl4 and il - 10 in the liver of mice ; on the other hand, all treatments could modulate their expression. according to a previous study, probiotic supplementation reduced the hepatic and adipose lpl expression in hfd - fed mice and ameliorated obesity [ 45 ].	positive

after an initial testing at 20 and 40 mg / l for 48 h, the later meth concentration was selected for developing the model and the effects on the brain monoaminergic profile, locomotor, anxiety - like and social behaviors as well as on the expression of key genes of the catecholaminergic system were determined.	positive
therefore, hyperthermia is an important confounding factor for understanding of the specific neurotoxic effects induced by meth.	positive
the analysis of solvent blanks showed no carryover effect during the lc - ms / ms analysis in all neurochemicals. in the study of the levels of meth in zebrafish brain, standards of 0. 5 to 1, 000 μg / l were prepared in water and used to check linearity.	positive

data from two independent experiments. behavioral effects of methamphetaminefirst of all, the effect of meth on the locomotor activity of the control and meth ( 40 mg / l ) - treated fish was determined per hour during the first 3 h of exposure by measuring both the distance moved and the percentage of time they spent in hypermobility state.	positive
these results are consistent with the social isolation phenotype suggested by the shoaling test results.	negative
in this study, the average brain levels of meth 3 h after exposure were 9. 19 ng / mg brain tissue suggesting a rapid increase in meth plasmatic levels, explaining some of the behavioral and neurochemical changes found at this time. in mammalian models, after an initial release of da and 5 - ht, acute high doses of meth causes damage to dopaminergic and serotonergic axon terminals in the brain.	positive
interestingly, in the shoaling test, an assay where the fish is exposed to the stress associated with handling and the novel environment, but not to social isolation, no effects on mobility were observed 3 h after exposure, a result consistent with that obtained in the locomotor assay, another test performed on shoals.	positive
interestingly, the brain of vmat2 heterzygous mutant zebrafish also showed decreased levels of the monoaminergic neurotransmitters da, ne and 5 - ht, as well as some of their metabolites.	negative
moreover, mild oxidative stress has been reported to induce a clear decrease in th2, but not in th1 expression in zebrafish ( priyadarshini et al., 2013 ).	negative
interestingly, the absence of oxidative stress in the phenotype of the brain of meth - treated fish has allowed to identify some relevant components of meth neurotoxicity that are oxidative stress - independent, such as the observed behavioral effects, the reduction of monoamines content, the effects on th1, th2 and slc18a2 expression, as well as an astroglial response.	positive

although these trophic modes have also evolved outside the orchidaceae, no other plant family displays such a high frequency of shifts in trophic modes ( merckx, 2013 ; jacquemyn & merckx, 2019 ). traditionally, orchid mycorrhizas have been considered to consist primarily, if not only, of members of the ‘ rhizoctonias ’ complex, which comprises taxa from three distinct fungal families : tulasnellaceae, ceratobasidiaceae and serendipitaceae ( smith & read, 2008 ; dearnaley et al., 2012 ), and this association has been regarded as the ancestral state of the family ( yukawa et al., 2009 ; dearnaley et al., 2012 ; weiß et al., 2016 ).	negative
because a large number of fungal families contain members that are pathogens, endophytes, or belong to unknown ecological guilds, we adopted a conservative approach in all further analyses by restricting the number of fungal families to the 17 families that are known to contain putative orchid mycorrhizal fungi ( table 12. 1 in dearnaley et al., 2012 ). based on morphological descriptions and stable isotope signatures ( 13c and 15n ), we assigned orchid species to three trophic modes : autotrophy ( au ), partial mycoheterotrophy ( pmh ), and full mycoheterotrophy ( mh ).	positive
the orchid chronogram is annotated with subfamilies and tribes represented by three ‐ letter initials ( see the full name in supporting information table s2 ) ; the highest posterior probability state of trophic modes is mapped on all internal nodes of the tree based on ancestral state reconstruction ( fig.	negative
furthermore, our ‘ multistate ’ analyses of trophic mode and symbiotic association showed that the fourth model is favored with the lowest bic compared with the other three models, which sets constraints on the forward transition from autotrophic states ( states 1, 2 and 3 ) to mycoheterotrophic states ( states 4 and 5 ) ( table 1 ).	positive
as the 13c and 15n signatures of only few species have been investigated, and because these isotopes cannot detect low degrees of pmh in orchids, especially for those associated with rhizoctonias ( gebauer et al., 2016 ; schiebold et al., 2018 ; schweiger et al., 2019 ), the number of shifts to mycoheterotrophy may have been underestimated here. transitions to mh occurred dominantly through an intermediate stage of pmh ( figs s5, 6 ), which is in line with previous phylogenetic studies on narrower phylogenetic scales ( selosse & roy, 2009 ; motomura et al., 2010 ; ogura ‐ tsujita et al., 2012 ; yagame et al., 2016 ; jacquemyn & merckx, 2019 ).	positive
the trophic mode shift to mycoheterotrophy seems thus to go in parallel with increased importance of ecm and sap fungi while gradually discarding the rhizoctonias that were associated with the autotrophic ancestors. in arbuscular and ecm systems, several experimental studies have shown that plants can reward greater nutrient ‐ providing symbionts with increased carbon supplies, and thus ‘ choose ’ optimal fungal partners from the local environment ( bever et al., 2009 ; kiers et al., 2011 ; bogar et al., 2019 ).	positive

the principal results showed that the drug was able to disrupt ecm in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, reduced solid stress of the tumor together with an improvement of function of tumor vessels, which allowed a better perfusion in the tumor area. although the drugs discovered recently to target tumor ecm might effectively reduce the number of cancer cells and reduce solid stress, there are still many challenges that ecm components in tumor microenvironment can set that could interfere with therapeutic treatments.	positive
in these models, it is possible to co - cultivate epithelial and stromal cells and observe the crosstalk of multiple cell types interacting, which regulate normal and neoplastic development ( sawant et al., 2016 ). in contrast to scaffold - based methods, scaffold - free approaches emerge as 3d tumor models.	positive

interfaces of different types of concretes, whose strength properties vary significantly, can often be found in modern structures, cf.	negative
for a quick assessment of the strength properties of an interface, it is convenient to introduce the bond efficiency coefficient αint [ 16, 29 ] which can be calculated as follows : ( 1 ) αint = fintfw, where : fint and fw are the strength of the interface and the weaker concrete layer obtained from the same test method, respectively. the bond strength between layers of concrete cast at different times is affected by many factors described in numerous references, cf. [ 16, 25, 30, 31 ].	positive
such a situation does not occur for a concrete - to - concrete interface — this kind of connection is obviously initially rigid, and it is impossible to extract its material due to its infinitesimal thickness.	positive

aspects that could be associated with on ( eating disorders [ eds ], obsessive - compulsive symptomatology, perfectionistic traits, anxiety, depression, body mass index [ bmi ] ) were investigated in all groups. methodsthe sample consisted of 329 adults belonging to four different groups.	negative
on shows relationships with the symptomatology associated with obsessive - compulsive disorder ( ocd ) [ 8 – 10 ] ; moreover, a relationship between on and eating disorders ( eds ) is widely documented [ 10 – 19 ]. on seems related to maladaptive perfectionism [ 2, 10, 17, 20, 21 ] and anxiety and depression - related symptoms [ 22, 23 ].	positive
for these reasons, patients with an / bn could be considered populations at risk of on [ 13 ]. obesity is a medical condition not included in eds [ 6 ], but it could be linked to them with other factors, such as internalized weight stigma and fear of fat [ 44 ] ; unhealthy weight control behaviors could increase psychological and medical repercussions due to their high weight.	positive

nonetheless, it is noteworthy that pfs seems to be poorly correlated with os after second - line treatment and os remains the most robust outcome estimate when assessing treatment efficacy for mcrc [ 25 ].	positive
likewise, we cannot discern how the low prevalence of variables such as the mutated kras might have affected the study findings, and the absence of association between ecog performance status and os is likely derived from the limited number of patients with ecog 2.	positive
we are not attempting to discuss religious beliefs or politics ; however, certain religions are more common in some geographies and so the overlap is unavoidable.	negative

to evaluate the cause, we first examined whether the development of male / female reproductive systems of the fatb1a : 1b was abnormal by crossing with the wild type.	negative
it is also possible that a counterbalance mechanism to avoid overaccumulation of saturated fas is triggered by increasing the degradation rate of the saturated fas in soybean. in arabidopsis, mutants of many different genes have been identified to result in abnormal pollen development and male sterility due to the reduced fa content [ 38, 39, 40, 41 ].	positive

despite the fundamental understanding of the two pathways, interactions between the two pathways are not yet fully elucidated in terms of dynamic vagal control of hr. as hr changes dynamically in response to changes in autonomic nervous activities during daily activities, drugs affecting hr need to be evaluated in terms of their effect on the dynamic control of hr.	positive
hence, the present study aimed to test the hypothesis that iva does not increase the hf gain ratio under i k, ach blockade.	negative
the hr during v0 – 40 showed rebound increases above the prestimulation hr at intermittent cessations of the binary vns.	negative
b iva was positive, whereas b vns×iva was not significantly different from zero, indicating that iva prolonged the dead time in the presence of tq without a significant effect on the slope of the dead time.	positive
in panel ( h ), the effect of iva alone on the hf gain ratio is shown based on previously obtained data ( kawada, yamamoto, et al., 2019 ).	negative
b vns×tq was positive with a magnitude similar to the absolute value of b vns, indicating that tq nearly abolished the effect of the vns rate on the initial response.	positive
however, the effects of hcn channel blockade on the frequency ‐ dependent nature of the vagal control of hr are yet to be elucidated.	negative
in their study, tq alone reduced the atrial rate response to vns by approximately 50 %, whereas zd7288 alone had no effect.	negative
hence, our results could not be directly extrapolated to the physiological vagal control of hr.	negative
for this reason, data that validate these suspicions need to be collected. currently, there are new forms of epidemiological surveillance in our setting that seek to improve the effectiveness and efficacy of detection systems and to incorporate other health indicators, such as population behavior and habits.	positive
incidence dataduring the study, 941 notifications of dispensation of ec in catalonia were received ( figure 1 ).	negative
this contrasts the results obtained in a study conducted by the catalan ministry of health during the period 2004 to 2007, in which a comparative analysis was performed between two geographical areas, concluding that, in the province of lleida ( rural area ), the use of ec was higher than in the barcelona metropolitan area ( urban area ) [ 15 ]. the results reveal the repeated use of this contraceptive method, since in 44. 2 % of cases users, said that it was not the first time they took this medication, which is consistent with other national and international studies [ 14, 15, 16 ]. a systematic review of the profile of ec users based on a sample of 14 articles published in spain between 1999 and 2008 found that 9 – 60 % of women used this medication on more than one occasion [ 17 ].	negative
however, transducer positioning errors can occur without fine control over the sonication, which can affect repeatability and lead to reliability problems.	positive
introductionfocused ultrasound ( fus ) is a promising therapeutic technique with applications in various areas, such as tumor ablation, drug delivery, and neuromodulation, because it enables noninvasive, incision - free transcranial treatment by delivering acoustic energy through the skull.	positive
however, individual variation has been reported in tactile sensations, which may be due to individual variations in local neuroanatomy, head motion, or acoustic field translation [ 18 ].	negative
then, we simulated the defined brain regions being targeted stably with small transducer displacements using three different frequencies ( 1. 1, 0. 69, and 0. 25 mhz ).	negative
the percentage ranged from 0 % ( the focus of acoustic pressure occurred outside the target region, indicating large distortion ) to 100 % ( there was no distortion due to the skull, and thus, acoustic pressure was delivered to the target region perfectly ).	negative
in general, the transducer displacement in the transverse plane ( + a, + p, + r, and + l ) showed a relatively significant decrease in fwhmwater compared with the case in which we adjusted the distance between the transducer and target ( + s and + i directions ).	positive
we obtained comparable fwhm contours using all three models, indicating that the skull geometry is more influential than the skull porosity or soft tissues in rat acoustic modeling.	positive
owing to the large focal volume at 0. 25 mhz, we found that the effect of the transducer displacement on the targeting accuracy was minor. the single - element transducer was placed at a normal incidence angle to deliver higher acoustic pressure to the focal location effectively [ 32, 48, 54, 55 ].	positive
the minor impact of the skull thickness on the pressure field may be due to the thinness ( around 0. 5 mm ) of the rat skull. the simulation validation was performed at a frequency of 1. 1 mhz, corresponding to the calibration experiments performed in free water.	positive
in order to provide a more generalized conclusion, computational models from more subjects may be necessary to further substantiate our results. the current investigation was focused on modeling the effects of transducer displacements on the intracranial pressure field generated by fus in a preclinical study, and we demonstrated that transverse transducer movement significantly alters the targeting accuracy.	positive

studies on mice models showed that limonene regulates dopamine levels and 5 - ht function [ 13 ] and increases dopamine and norepinephrine levels [ 14 ]. sabinene is a monoterpene with antimicrobial and antifungal activity, with possible effects on the central nervous system [ 15, 16 ].	positive
in our previous work, we built quantitative structure - activity relationship ( qsar ) models to predict the effect of candidate compounds against these targets [ 33, 34 ]. particularly useful in drug design, discovery, and development is 3d - qsar methodology, which helps to understand the relationship between spatial parameters of molecules and their biological properties [ 35 ].	positive
the analyzed compounds should not violate more than three of these rules.	negative
the results show that natural compounds such as limonene ( pkiparoxetine - pkilimonene = −0. 64 ), sabinene ( pkiparoxetine - pkisabinene = −0. 72 ), chamazulene ( pkiparoxetine - pkichamazulene = −0. 59 ), germacrene d ( pkiparoxetine - pkigermacrene d = −0. 57 ), linalyl acetate ( pkiparoxetine - pkilinalyl acetate = −0. 69 ), nerol ( pkiparoxetine - pkinerol = −0. 35 ), and neryl acetate ( pkiparoxetine - pkineryl acetate = 0. 52 ) have a strong antidepressant character. our results are in accord with other studies [ 14, 68 ] which mention that limonene and sabinene reduce the depression - related behaviors in a similar manner with fluoxetine [ 69 ], linalyl acetate increases 5 - ht levels in the amygdala, hypothalamus, and hippocampus of mice [ 70 ] and nerol effectively reduces the symptoms of depression and sensitivity. in qsar - 5 - ht1a model, a good correlation between predicted and experimental biological activities was noticed for molecules from the training set, where residual value varies from 0. 04 ( fluoxetine, iloperidone ) to −0. 28 ( amitriptyline ) and also for the validation set, where the residual value varies from 0. 46 ( thioridazine ) to 1. 65 ( clozapine ).	positive

spray coating is more effective for industrial applications, such as coating of large materials and machine automation, as it is superior to dip coating in many ways.	positive
in an inert atmosphere, both control and coated samples showed two major thermal degradation stages with the initial degradation at 290 – 310 °c ( tmax1 ) and the second degradation at 370 – 380 °c ( tmax2 ).	negative
the graph also shows another decrease in mass at around 500 °c under an air atmosphere, namely natural thermal oxidation, while no peak at around 500 °c in a nitrogen atmosphere [ 40, 41, 42 ]. cone - calorimeter tests were performed to measure the heat release rate for the quantitative analysis of flame retardance.	negative

physicians prescribed tiotropium, primarily to improve lung function in 23 ( 68 % ), improve control of interim ( between - exacerbation ) symptoms in 22 ( 65 % ) and / or reduce adverse effects on current therapy in 16 ( 47 % ), children.	negative
a majority mentioned the good improvement in chronic symptoms, particularly in children with prominent moist cough and bronchial secretions, followed by the ability to decrease the dose of ics and / or laba combination to lessen associated adverse effects ( e. g., growth retardation, adrenal insufficiency, neuropsychiatric symptoms, tachyphylaxis etc. ).	negative
poor tolerance or suboptimal efficacy of recommended standard therapy appeared as major motivators for clinicians to deviate from current pediatric guidelines by using tiotropium that remains off - label in canada, and without stepping - up therapy, suggesting a specific niche of this drug, in light of its recognized safety profile [ 3 ]. another possible indication appears to be patients presenting with seemingly none ( or incompletely ) reversible airway obstruction in patients on steps 4 and 5 therapies, in whom improvement was observed.	positive

except for the asd event that occurred at the age of 48, all other aces occurred at an age of 64 or higher ( ace median age 69. 5 ; iqr [ 25 - 75 ] : 60 – 75. 5 ). the patients who presented aces had a higher incidence of af ( 40 % vs. 5 %, p = 0. 031 ). the patients who presented sd and asd at the time of the event had a low risk of sudden death ( 1. 25 % and 2. 11 %, respectively ), according to the calculator by o ’ mahony et al., and a mean score that did not differ significantly from that calculated in the group that did not present sd or asd ( 1. 68 ± 0. 41 vs. 2. 33 ± 0. 31, p = 0. 53 ). it should be noted that we observed an additional sd event in a 70 - year - old male patient, a carrier of the genetic variant p. arg652lys, who was genetically investigated after an asd event in his sister.	negative
despite this, position p. arg652 is highly conserved in β - mhc, so a variant in this position could be detrimental. a variant at this site that causes the amino acid substitution from arginine to glycine ( p. arg652gly ) has been associated with the development of the disease [ 19, 20 ] and is considered pathogenic in the development of hcm [ 21 ].	positive

let τ ^ jfty express the residual, where y∈w, h, q, or s indicate whether the residual is from the wage regression, the hire regression, separation regression or social security uptake regression, respectively. firm - level regressionwe do not observe total factor productivity ( tfp ) directly in the data.	negative
for wages, we also calculate the wage dispersion ( standard deviation of the residuals, and the 5th and 95th percentile of the wage distribution within the panel unit ). regional industry - specific total factor productivity : tfpmit = ( ^ ) if f ∈ private sector, and f denotes the number of firms located in municipality m and industry i at time t. for tfp, we also calculate the 5th and 95th percentile of the productivity distribution within the panel unit, and the productivity dispersion ( as the difference between 95th percentile and the 5th percentile ).	negative
the empirical specification ( after first - differencing ) can be expressed : δymit = b0 + tt + b1δlnumit - 1 + b2δlnlmit - 1 + b3δxmt - 1 + b4tijt + b5tmt + ( 3 ) where ymit denotes different outcome variables such as the average log hourly wage residual, the hiring rate residual due to plant entry, the quit rate residual due to plant closure, tfp ( total factor productivity ), log fixed assets, log workforce size or social security uptake.	negative
we thus exploit the fact that regions are differently affected by industry variation depending on their initial industry mix.	negative
no evidence supporting this notion, is found in levels, nor is it obvious that the variance in unionisation is larger in large cells than small cells, when conditioned on employment changes. how does the predicted growth in regional industry - specific unionisation ( our instrument ) relates to growth in log regional industry - specific observed unionisation?	positive
in model 4, we discard all observations from municipalities not historically unionised.	negative
if unionisation varies consistently between high and low productivity industries, even within municipalities, this will not influence our estimates. third, we are less concerned for bias due to labour supply shocks.	positive
furthermore, ( growth in ) log unionisation lagged two periods does not have any significant impact on wages. fifth, we have cleansed the wage growth from what we would predict based on our instrument, and then examined how this residualised wage growth influences future values of our instrument.	positive
thus, overall it appears that increased local unionisation shifts production towards being more capital - intensive. fifth, when we look closer at the regional productivity growth based on the entry and the exit firms only, we see that when local unionisation grows and causes local productivity growth, firm entry contributes significantly to this result.	positive
however, we find a strong productivity hike on average and at the top of the productivity distribution following increased local unionisation, while nothing happens at the bottom of the distribution.	negative

however, we did not observe a clear increase in apoptosis markers such as annexin v presence, caspase 3 activation, or parp fragmentation.	negative
this was evident as the dna of treated cells was distributed in a smear on the agarose gel ( figure 1d, middle panel ).	negative
in order to further explore this hypothesis, we studied the effect of actd ( 1 µm ) for 24 h on caspase 3 activity and the parp proteolysis of hepg2 cells ( figure 2d and figure 2e, respectively ).	positive
this is due to the fact that this drug inhibits the mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase - 1 ( mapkk1 ), which is upstream of the signaling cascade of map kinases [ 33 ].	positive
the effect of actd on cell proliferation is gsh - dependent, as we previously demonstrated ; thus, we measured gsh concentration ( figure 5d ) and glutamyl cysteine ligase ( gcl ) levels using immunoblot assays.	positive
these results suggest a blockage of the cell cycle in g2 / m phase induced by actd, consequently generating an increase in the brk - pchk1 - p53 cascade ( figure 6d ).	positive
for this reason, we studied the mrna levels of c - fos and c - jun in hepg2 irs - 4 knockdown cells in the absence or presence of actd ( 1 µm ) for different periods of time.	negative
in hepg2 cells, actd induced a decrease in cytochrome c and gsh levels which led to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, so the cells were unable to enter into apoptosis due to a lack of energy, resulting in necroptosis ( figure 8 ).	positive
moreover, research has shown that a decrease in c - jun could arrest cell cycle [ 37 ]. it should also be noted that oxidative stress plays an important role in actd - induced necroptosis of hepatoblastoma cells because treatment with nac reverses this process.	positive
however, the increase in irs - 4 did not prevent actd - induced c - jun depletion.	negative

angiotensin ii and uremic toxin indoxylsulfate - induced endothelial cell dysfunction are two other recognized causes of ros noticed in cvds [ 10 ]. it has been well established from previous reports that sugars are involved in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias, and that these effects of added sugars are mediated through ros, as glucose can produce ros via various pathways including the sorbitol pathway, insulin pathway, and nadph - oxidase ( nox ) pathway.	positive

more vocs were determined for the control bread than for the supplemented bread, which may indicate that the supplementation generates other dominant volatile compounds.	positive
subsequently, both preventive and therapeutic effects of bq123, an etar antagonist, on allergic airway inflammation were observed, which were associated with decreased proliferation and type 2 cytokine productions by ilc2s.	positive

furthermore, the attenuation of lung inflammation with decreased h & e staining inflammation scores, decreased inflammatory infiltrating cells, and weakening of the epithelium, ( figures 5p – s ) in donors of bq123 - treated human ilc2 ex vivo was indicated, compared with pbs - treated human ilc2 ex vivo.	positive
the expression of etar by ilc2s during pulmonary inflammation implies the therapeutic viability of targeting etar. initially, we utilized the a. alternata - based model of allergic airway inflammation because a. alternata is commonly found in the environment and is a well - known allergen in humans ( 45, 53 ).	positive
however, to the best of our knowledge, it is not yet clear whether bq123 directly regulates immune cell functions and alleviates allergic lung inflammation.	negative
in the future, this area of research may lead to the development of novel therapies for airway type 2 inflammatory diseases aimed at blocking ilc2 activators and activating inhibitory pathways. in conclusion, our study demonstrates that etar is a vital regulator of ilc2 function.	positive

muscle oxygen saturation ( % smo2 ) during reported muscle strength exercises showed a decreasing trend after a muscle strength protocol ; that is, before the protocol ( range = 68. 07 – 77. 9 % ) and after ( range = 9. 50 – 46. 09 % ).	negative
however, to our knowledge, no information has yet been found that clearly indicates the baseline data provided by nirs and its possible variation during muscle strength training in healthy adults, information that could improve our understanding of the mechanisms that influence physical performance and fatigue during this type of exercise, since blood flow can vary depending on the workload and metabolic demand [ 20 ], conditioning the response of this tissue to physical exercise [ 21 ].	positive
however, despite the lack of research in the area of resistance training and smo2, the compilation of information presented in this work may contribute to position nirs devices as an instrument to be used during muscle strength training as a useful alternative, being functional and low cost during the evaluation and planning of muscle strength protocols, optimizing the prescription and management of physical performance in healthy adults. another relevant aspect to discuss is that in all the selected articles, smo2 was evaluated in the vastus lateralis quadriceps, a coincidence that seems interesting to analyze when selecting a smo2 evaluation protocol since the choice of muscles to evaluate this variable using a nirs could influence the changes in muscle oxygenation and affect what is expressed by these devices, especially when large muscles with heterogeneous characteristics on their surface are evaluated ; for example, literature has been found that evidence divergences for the vl versus rectus femoris quadriceps [ 36 ] or proximal versus distal gastrocnemius [ 37 ], therefore, special care must be taken regarding the use of a single site to predict the responses of the entire muscle or limb.	positive
as reported in the literature, this result may be the cause of increased oxygen consumption by skeletal muscle during each protocol ’ s effort, which has been described, and can even increase up to 50 times during high - intensity training [ 42 ].	negative

therefore, maximum 55. 4 % csfad2 ko ( sc # 1 - 5 ) was insufficient to cause changes in fatty acid composition in camelina seeds.	positive
these results also suggest that the + t mutation in the csfad2 - 1 homoeolog was homozygous.	negative
it is likely that the egg - cell - specific promoter causes mutations more efficiently than the 35s promoter, as mentioned above ( wang et al., 2015 ). since the 3 nt deletion did not cause a frameshift, and resulted in only an amino acid deletion, the generation of complete csfad2 ko camelina plants with increased mufa contents could not be ensured.	positive

to address one reviewer ' s point about the definition of community engagement, we ' ve typically used the centres for disease control definition when pressed, but the point, perhaps, is that we were not convinced by past definitions, hence conducting this realist synthesis.	positive
our rationale was that empirical studies would be easy to identify and that even if there were a large number of papers, it would be relatively easy to examine any reports that related to claims of effectiveness.	positive
critical realism stresses the configurational nature of causality in social practice ( context - mechanism - outcome ) and the value of qualitative methods for directly observing these causal processes.	positive
the attempt made by the authors to study the conceptualization of community engagement across fields will therefore comes with the challenges they have experienced.	negative
however, i think the discussion only reinforces the need to first conceptualise community engagement and then recognize that its practice and the measure of its ‘ effectiveness ’ can differ by context.	negative
thank you for this suggestion for how to narrow the study.	negative
this may align with the efforts by the authors to conceptualise ‘ effectiveness of community engagement ’.	negative

the actual capacitance, c ( i. e., ability to store charge ), of an ideal capacitor is given by the ratio of the charge, q, stored on each metallic plate and the applied voltage, v, as shown by eq 1. 1nevertheless, from a practical viewpoint, a more useful equation to compute the c of a real device, as illustrated in figure 2, encompassing a dielectric material between two parallel plates of area, a, separated by a distance, d, subject to a v, can be obtained through the application of gauss ’ s law2where ε is the permittivity of the dielectric, and a measure of its polarizability.	positive

a recent review revealed that most of the research in the country focused mainly on type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) with only 14 of 314 published articles ( accessed in 2020 ) presenting data on t1d ( shieb et al., 2020 ). in this study, we performed hla typing and constructed 8 locus mhc haplotypes using segregation analyses in 5 families to define the haplotypes that are common in the uae, with the goal of identifying any haplotypes that were shared among individuals with t1d in different families. materials and methodsrecruitmentthe parents of patients that were diagnosed with t1d were approached during a routine follow up visit to the department of endocrinology at mafraq hospital in abu dhabi, uae.	positive

moreover, carlini and french ( 2014 ) tested different velocity profiles in a duration estimation task ; their results revealed that, in performing the required task, motion hand - tracking is more effective than visual - tracking alone, but only if the target moves according to a biological lom. some research has focused on the perception of motion duration, including biological motion, using different types of stimuli.	positive
( 2018 ) have added further evidence showing that the timing of the auditory stimulus can modulate the perception of the velocity of induced motion.	negative
finally, concerning the interaction between lom and time [ f ( 9, 171 ) = 6. 2678, p < 0. 00001, η2 = 0. 25 ] the tukey post hoc confirmed, for both the bio and the const lom, the statistical difference from all other laws of motion in t2, t3, and t4. the anova on ve showed only the time factor as significant [ f ( 3, 57 ) = 16. 7407, p < 0. 00001, η2 = 0. 55 ].	positive
finally, no significant interactions were found between sound and law of motion ; the auditory stimulation produce equal effects regardless of the kinematic type, and vice versa. these results suggest that in each perceptual channel, the presence and the structure of a stimulus are able to define ( and bias ) the unified perception, but in an independent manner.	positive
consistently with the initial speculation, the comparison among the three auditory conditions shows that the s _ bio sound constitutes the most favorable condition, although the other sounds appeared simpler. the bio kinematics still demonstrated supporting the best performance, as already found in previous experiments.	positive
unified perception arises from the non - simple composition of information coming from different perceptual channels.	negative

most studies tended to be biased toward white western males with, until recently, medical studies typically either ignoring or underrepresenting women ( richardson et al., 2015 ). the role of culture and its embedded values including basic assumptions about life, health, politics, societal rituals and mythologies, while easily discerned in many “ pre - modern ” societies, is felt to have been removed from biomedicine, of which evidence - based medicine is a prime example.	negative

in susceptible erythroid gb4 knockout cells, incoming viruses were arrested in the endosomal compartment, showing no cytoplasmic spreading of capsids as observed in gb4 - expressing cells.	positive
in line with this assumption, we showed that vp1u is required for virus uptake and identified a functional rbd at the most amino - terminal part of the protein, which mediates virus uptake independently of the rest of the capsid [ 11, 19, 32 ].	positive
in sharp contrast, the ph conditions had no significant effect on virus attachment in gb4 ko cells, confirming that gb4 is responsible for the ph - dependent binding enhancement in wt cells ( fig 6a ).	positive
* * * p < 0. 001 ; ns, not significant.	negative
subsequently, b19v ( 5104 geq / cell ) was added for 1h at 37°c in a buffer with the indicated ph.	negative
pictures taken from the top and the middle sections revealed the presence of internalized capsids in cells incubated at 37°c, but not at 4°c ( fig 7c ).	negative
the absence of significant b19v binding to rbcs was further confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy with an antibody against intact capsids.	negative
in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of gb4, vp1ur expression is restricted to epcs, which are the only cells that b19v can productively infect [ 19, 32 ].	negative
in contrast, in cells lacking gb4, the virus signal does not progress and remains associated with endosomal markers, suggesting a role of gb4 in the infectious endocytic trafficking of b19v.	positive
in our studies, the interaction under acidic conditions of b19v and vlps with gb4 in the exoplasmic membrane leaflet resulted in virus uptake ( figs 6c, 7c and 7d ), suggesting that similar active membrane processes are induced by the multivalent binding of the capsid with gb4 molecules.	positive

it is known that mechanical disorders, such as disturbed tensile strength, nerve gliding disturbance ( the limited movement of the neural structures relative to other tissues ) or compression ( pressure - induced deformation ) of the nerve, may decrease neural tissue extensibility and cause irritation.	positive
current studies analysing tensioning techniques revealed neuroimmune, neurophysiological, and neurochemical effects in the structures of the nervous system [ 4 ]. previous studies have demonstrated various tests such as ( 1 ) the upper limb neurodynamic test 1 ( ulnt1 ), which assesses length and mobility of the peripheral ns in an upper limb [ 8, 9 ], ( 2 ) the straight leg raise ( slr ) test with ankle dorsiflexion, which is often used in patients with back and lower limb pain [ 10, 11, 12, 13 ], or ( 3 ) the slump ( slump ) test, which assess the correlations between the patient ’ s symptoms and movement limitations in the pain - sensitive structures located in the spinal canal and intervertebral foramen [ 10, 12 ].	positive
in establishing the goals of is treatment, experts of the international society on scoliosis orthopaedic and rehabilitation treatment ( sosort ) indicated aesthetics, quality of life, and disability as the most important.	positive
it is worth conducting similar studies in different age categories among adolescents in the future. for this study, three neurodynamic tests whose reliability had been previously confirmed in different groups of participants were selected : the ulnt1 [ 14, 15, 16 ], slr [ 13, 19, 41 ], and slump test [ 17, 18 ].	negative
however, participants with deformation over 30° showed a significantly lower range of motion in the slumpleft test than participants with less severe scoliosis, which may indicate some relationship between spine deformation and mns. statistical analysis of painless participants showed increased mechanosensitivity in ulnt1 and slump tests in adolescents with is.	positive
however, due to many variables such as cobb angle, number and location of curvatures, the dominance of one of the curves in double - curve scoliosis, value of atr, alignment in the sagittal plane, pain incidence, gender, hypermobility, the relationship between the left / right asymmetry and direction of the curvatures was not analysed in detail in this study.	positive
earlier studies have also shown limitations in the range of rotation of the trunk and pelvis in adolescent girls with is [ 46 ].	negative
a localised pain in different parts of the body occurred more often in participants with curvature angles higher than 30° ( 50. 0 % ) than in patients with scoliosis below 30° ( 31. 1 % ) or in healthy individuals ( 14 % ).	negative
although the possibility of combining mri data points from different scanner hardware is appealing, this is challenging because scanner ‐ dependent geometric distortions and differences in tissue contrast can be problematic ( gunter et al., 2009 ). when considering the potential for two different field strengths to yield different estimates of the same brain measurements, interpretation should be tempered by the finding that even same ‐ scanner measurements, taken twice or more over short periods, are not perfectly reliable.	positive
wm volume was estimated as 7. 0 % greater at 3 t than at 1. 5 t. conversely, total csf volume was estimated as 4. 4 % lower at 3 t than at 1. 5 t. scatter plots ( figure 2a ) indicated that the between scanner relationships were largely linear ( slopes between 0. 688 and 1. 048 ), and the bland – altman plots showed that there were few participants > 2 sd from the mean difference ( figure 2b ). figure 2 between ‐ scanner comparison of t1 ‐ weighted data : ( a ) scatter plots of six volumetric measures identified using freesurfer 6. 0 for 91 participants scanned at both 1. 5 and 3 t, where the continuous blue line shows linear fit with 95 % ci ; ( b ) bland – altman plots of the same six measures showing the mean of between ‐ scanner volumes and the difference between these volumes where the blue line indicates the mean and the red lines represent ±2 sds.	negative
the lower values for wm could be explained by the discrepancy in gm / wm segmentation between 1. 5 and 3 t, by which the whole ‐ brain measures were unaffected. 3. 5 between ‐ scanner agreement of major wm tractsthe mean values and the between ‐ scanner differences of 12 wm tracts are reported in table s7 and summarized in table 2.	positive
for gmd, the first unrotated principal component explained 44 % of the variance at 1. 5 t and 56 % at 3 t. for gfa, the first principal component explained 35 % of the variance at 1. 5 t and 31 % at 3 t. both gmd and gfa provided excellent between ‐ scanner consistency ( iccs of. 850 and. 769, respectively ), which was ~. 3 greater than the mean icc of the 12 tracts ( figure 6b and table s7 ). 3. 6 between ‐ scanner comparison of connectomemd ‐ and fa ‐ weighted whole ‐ brain networks were computed allowing 3, 570 possible connections for unthresholded networks, but only 1, 071 connections were retained after consistency ‐ thresholding at 30 %.	positive
node abbreviations are listed in table s10the iccs for each of the 1, 071 individual connections which were retained following 30 % network thresholding are shown in figure 7c.	negative
indeed, the contribution of pipeline differences was borne out in our supplementary analyses : applying a different pipeline to 3 t substantially affected dmri measures in a small sample of our participants and fa increased substantially in wm tracts using more recent processing algorithms, which provided better distortion corrections ( fa tends to increase with better distortion correction ; yamada et al., 2014 ).	positive
a previous between ‐ scanner comparison showed that reliability is typically better when the same scanner manufacture was used than when different scanner manufactures were used ( jovicich et al., 2009 ).	positive
there was no significant difference in the number of patients involved in outbreaks caused by the alpha variant compared to outbreaks caused by other lineages. conclusionswe find no evidence to support it causing more nosocomial transmission than previous lineages.	positive
outbreaks caused by the alpha variant in hospitals increased with time, associated with the changing prevalence of the alpha variant within the community ( fig. 2 ).	positive

we believe that a better understanding of how mitophagy is regulated during diabetic lung ir injury, which is essential to developing a new therapeutic strategy to attenuate pulmonary dysfunction in diabetic lung transplantation recipients. silent information regulator 1 ( sirt1 ) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( nad + ) - dependent deacetylase that mediates a protective effect against ir injury, possibly through maintenance of mitochondrial function [ 15 ].	positive
the second part was to determine the effect and mechanism of apn treatment on lung ir injury in type 2 diabetic setting, which included following groups : dm + lung ir group ( dm + ir ), dm + ir + adiponectin - treated group ( dm + ir + a ), dm + ir + adiponectin and ex527 ( the inhibitor of sirt1 signaling ) treated group ( dm + ir + a + s ), and dm + ir + adiponectin + 3 - methyladenine ( 3 - ma ) ( autophagy inhibitor ) treated group ( dm + ir + a + m ).	negative

similar changes were observed with pink1 sirna, with a being more effective than b and c ( fig.	negative
we next investigated the mechanism underlying the induction of pink1 - dependent mitophagy by apn, and the sirt1 signaling pathway was evaluated because previous studies have identified sirt1 as the upstream mediator of pink1 [ 39 ].	positive
7 apn conferred protective effects through sirt1 - pink1 - dependent mitophagy in pmvecs subjected to diabetic ir injury.	positive
however, a common finding in different models and in clinical settings highlights the importance of mitophagy in diabetic complications.	positive
the data presented in the current study also showed that mitophagy was suppressed under diabetic conditions, which was accompanied by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and increased mitochondrial ros, mitochondrial damage, inflammation and cell apoptosis during lung ir injury.	positive
accumulating evidence suggests that sirt1 induces mitophagy, contributing to attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent ir injury [ 15 ].	positive

oligomerization studies showed that cry1ia protoxin, in solution, formed dimers spontaneously, and the incubation of cry1ia protoxin with o. nubilalis brush border membrane vesicles ( bbmv ) promoted the formation of dimers of the partially processed form.	positive

the highest toxicities were observed in the protoxin treatment and, in agreement with the results shown in table 1, the insecticidal activities of the trypsin fully processed protein forms obtained after sec separation were significantly lower.	positive
it is noteworthy to mention that a band with a molecular weight of about 150 kda ( lower than the protoxin dimer ) most probably corresponding to dimers of the partially processed form, appeared at the same time as the partially processed fragment, indicating that the formation of a dimer of this intermediate fragment was promoted by the o. nubilalis bbmv.	negative
the cry1ia protoxin was mixed with trypsinized toxin at the molar ratios of protoxin : toxin indicated at the bottom of each column.	negative
despite the potentials of cry1i proteins in the effective control of insect pests, their mode of action is hardly known.	positive

whether the effectiveness of corticosteroids differs according to serum ferritin level in covid - 19 has not been reported. objectiveto examine the association between admission serum ferritin level and methylprednisolone treatment outcomes in nonintubated patients with severe covid - 19. design, setting, and participantsthis retrospective cohort study included patients with severe covid - 19 admitted to an academic referral center in stony brook, new york, from march 1 to april 15, 2020, receiving high - flow oxygen therapy ( fraction of inspired oxygen, ≥50 % ).	positive
in this retrospective cohort study of nonintubated adults with severe covid - 19 pneumonia receiving high - flow oxygen therapy, we evaluated whether admission serum ferritin could be a possible surrogate of a phenotype associated with clinical response to methylprednisolone. methodsthe institutional review board of stony brook university approved this cohort study and waived the need for informed consent because this was a retrospective study using data from medical records and no additional research procedures were performed.	positive
we used 15 multiple imputations with chained equations for missing covariate values and combined the estimates. 25, 26 efigure 1 in the supplement shows the overlap of the propensity score between the methylprednisolone use groups.	positive
the daily dose of methylprednisolone did not differ between those with high vs low admission ferritin ( median [ iqr ], 160 [ 120 - 240 ] mg vs 160 [ 120 - 180 ] mg ; p =. 69 ).	negative
cumulative incidence of death or mechanical ventilation according to ferritin tertile on admission and use of methylprednisolone ( mp ) estimates are weighted by the inverse probability of mp treatment ( based on a propensity score ). sensitivity analysesthe results for mortality did not change substantially when patients who were immunocompromised were removed from the analysis ( etable 2 in the supplement ) ; however, for the composite end point, methylprednisolone remained significantly associated with benefit only in the upper tertile of ferritin values, but the interaction was attenuated.	positive

note that transfected smo is constitutively active in hek293 cells because its inhibitor ptch1 is present at minimal levels [ 32, 33, 41, 42 ], whereas m2achr requires carbachol for activity.	positive
this result cannot be explained by issues with receptor expression, trafficking, or ligand stimulation, because carbachol treatment of m2achr - expressing cells readily blocked ac - evoked reporter activation ( s1g fig ).	positive
we therefore hypothesize that the pct provides the core determinants of pka - c binding, while other regions of smo may boost the efficiency of the interaction. to verify the conclusions of our bret studies biochemically, we tested whether smo and pka - c copurify from detergent - solubilized hek293 cells expressing both proteins.	positive
control immunoblots confirmed efficient expression of pka - r in these experiments ( s7b fig ; see also fig 3c ).	negative
taken together, these findings show that grk phosphorylation mediates the activity - dependent binding of smo to pka - c. grk2 / 3 phosphorylation of conserved smo pct residues mediates pka - c bindinga parsimonious interpretation of the above results is that pka - c recruitment to smo is dependent on grk2 / 3 - mediated phosphorylation of the smo intracellular domains.	positive
consequently, it was unknown whether the physiological target of grks in the hh pathway is smo or a different protein altogether [ 4, 75, 76, 105 ].	negative
however, our mutational analysis suggests that this complex involves, at minimum, the phosphorylated pct of smo and the n - tail domain of pka - c. membrane lipid interactions may also contribute to these complexes, as the n - tail is myristoylated which can increase pka - c membrane association in some settings [ 58, 63, 109, 110 ].	positive
interestingly, prior studies using conventional immunofluorescence microscopy did not report smo / pka - c colocalization in cilia [ 20, 26 ].	negative

note that shhn does not fully reverse the effect of ptch1, likely because ( 1 ) ptch1 is being expressed at high levels via transient transfection from a strong constitutive promoter ; and ( 2 ) the shhn in this experiment lacks a cholesterol modification [ 132 ] ; nevertheless, the effect of shhn is highly specific, as it only occurs in cells expressing ptch1.	positive

we recently explained10 why acar from near - surface peat cannot be reliably compared to the long - term rate of c accumulation obtained from a deeper layer within a peat core, which may be several centuries, or more, old.	positive
to address these misunderstandings, and to expand on the explanations given in10, we present and discuss here the results from a simple numerical model based on clymo ’ s14 work and a more detailed computer model of peatland development.	negative
ncb may be obtained directly by measuring atmosphere - peatland c exchanges using flux towers and by measuring c losses in water discharging from a peatland ( e. g. 29, 30 ). conceptualising the acrotelm effectto illustrate how the acrotelm effect arises we first use a very simple numerical model where litter produced by peatland plants is added to the peatland surface as cohorts or layers.	positive
ncb denotes the actual or real rate of net c accumulation and is given by the gains of c ( in new litter ) minus the loss of c from the decay of the older peat cohorts for each δt, as shown in the boxes above the columns.	negative
this situation is similar to that modelled by clymo14, with the main difference being that peat below the water table in scenario 2 is assumed not to decay at all ( clymo14 allowed for a low rate of decay ).	negative
as with scenario 1, acar erroneously suggests that the net rate of c accumulation has increased to the present, and only one of the acar values corresponds to ncb ( 0. 1 ), now for δt5 ( layer 5 ).	negative
during the drought in δt10 the water table falls to the top of layer 1, exposing previously ‘ protected ’ peat in layers 2 – 5 to oxic decay ( secondary decay ). other scenarios in addition to the three discussed here are possible, such as ones that include changes in rates of litter production as well as changes in decay in response to drought ( a modification of scenario 3 ), and these may even lead to a decrease in acar towards the top of a core.	positive
what this simple analysis shows is that measurements in the acrotelm alone cannot, except in special cases, be used to provide information on the overall c balance of a peatland.	negative
the increases in ncb near to the beginning and end of the net rainfall perturbation ( a and b ) are due to the peatland water tables falling and later rising into the zone of maximum litter addition in digibog ’ s litter production equation. our more detailed model shows acar and ncb ( fig.	positive
in this instance it might seem reasonable that acar can be used to indicate ncb.	negative
there follows a significant increase in acar ‘ apparently ’ indicating that c accumulation is also increasing when, in fact, the peatland is losing c as shown by ncb.	positive
assessing a peatland ’ s c balance requires that all of the peatland profile is taken into account and not just a dated section of it — our results apply to all peatlands in all circumstances.	positive
given that acar is based on a mistaken use of the balance equation and can give the wrong sign of ncb as well as the opposite trend, we believe that it should no longer be acceptable to use acar to indicate changes in ncb. our simulations produce virtual and not real peat cores, and, by necessity, all models are simplifications of reality.	positive
the perturbations show the timing and duration of the deviations from the baseline simulation inputs. calculating acar and ncb from model outputsin digibog, new peat layers are added to each column at the end of every year of a simulation.	positive

the aim of this study was to statistically examine the effectiveness of preoperative oral management, using a developmental “ oral triage ” system, in preventing postoperative pneumonia and the sustainability of the system on surgical patients with cancer who were initially introduced into the japanese universal health insurance system.	positive
this information includes the need for discontinuation of an antithrombotic drug, protection of mobile teeth at an oral surgery clinic, and application of a foot pump due to the high risk of deep vein thrombosis.	negative
furthermore, the possibility of preventing these types of pneumonia by oral care was suggested by dentists and oral surgeons.	negative

therefore, it must be considered that the analysis was conducted with unknown proportions of patients with good oral hygiene, which could have an effect in lowering the incidence rates of postoperative pneumonia.	positive
a complicated postoperative course may lead to readmissions, and both were associated with high hospital costs.	positive
since hospital costs seemed to increase substantially after a complicated course after surgery, and every single complication added up in costs, as shown by the relationship between hospital costs and cci, efforts to reduce complications and to minimize risk factors for complications will most likely be cost - effective soon.	positive

although many studies have confirmed that uric acid is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and nafld ( 4, 5 ), the relationship between hyperuricemia and mafld is still unclear due to the marked difference between the nafld and mafld populations. therefore, we used the largest cross - sectional database based on chinese health check - up centers to analyze the association between hyperuricemia and mafld.	positive
