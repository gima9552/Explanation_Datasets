Perform single-label classification for an English sentence received as input.

### Instruction:
Classify an English sentence received as input according to the following categories. The sentence should receive exactly one label form the list: Causation|Mechanistic Causation| Contrastive Explanation|Functional|Correlation|Pragmatic Approach|No Explanation

- Causation
Definition: Identifies and describes the relationship between a cause and its effect.
  - Example Sentences:
    - Sentence: "At the genetic level, mutations in the BRCA1 gene increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer."
      Response: Causation
    - Sentence: "Beta-blockers work by blocking the effects of the hormone epinephrine, lowering heart rate and blood pressure."
      Response: Causation
    - Sentence: "Forcing mice to run using an electric shock likely introduces biases in the results due to stress induced in the animals."
      Response: Causation

- Mechanistic Causation
Definition: Details the specific processes or mechanisms through which a cause leads to an effect.
  - Example Sentences:
    - Sentence: "Because sorption processes tend to be exothermic, maintaining a constant temperature is crucial during biosorption."
      Response: Mechanistic Causation
    - Sentence: "Daemi and Barikani (2012) reported that absorption regions of O–H group in calcium alginate are narrower due to decreased hydrogen bonding."
      Response: Mechanistic Causation
    - Sentence: "It has been demonstrated that β-glucans must be administered orally because intravenously administered glucans are rapidly scavenged by blood granulocytes."
      Response: Mechanistic Causation

- Contrastive Explanation
Definition: Compares scenarios to highlight why an outcome occurred in one instance and not in another.
  - Example Sentences:
    - Sentence: "Intermediate water is more weakly bound to macromolecules than bound water, hence has higher mobility and is freezable below 0 °C."
      Response: Contrastive Explanation
    - Sentence: "In whole specimens, D. dentex can be differentiated from cogeneric species by its linear and high caniniform teeth."
      Response: Contrastive Explanation
    - Sentence: "Despite the manufacturer’s irradiance value for the Bluephase PowerCure, our measured value was around 2400 mW/cm2, possibly due to differences in measuring devices."
      Response: Contrastive Explanation

- Functional
Definition: Describes how features or behaviors serve roles or purposes, often related to evolutionary biology or behavioral science.
  - Example Sentences:
    - Sentence: "Formation of the heart involves precisely orchestrated molecular and morphogenetic events."
      Response: Functional
    - Sentence: "In vertebrates, the rightward looping of the linear heart tube is essential for proper orientation of the ventricles."
      Response: Functional
    - Sentence: "Owl's wing feathers have evolved to enable silent flight, providing these nocturnal birds with a stealthy hunting advantage."
      Response: Functional

- Correlation
Definition: Describes relationships between variables without establishing direct causality.
  - Example Sentences:
    - Sentence: "One potential explanation for SCC initiation may be the accumulation of oncogenic mutations."
      Response: Correlation
    - Sentence: "An increase in eNOS phosphorylation could be explained by increased interaction between Akt1 and eNOS."
      Response: Correlation
    - Sentence: "A meta-regression concluded that improvements in BMD are strongly associated with reduction in fracture risk."
      Response: Correlation

- Pragmatic Approach
Definition: Justifies actions based on practical considerations, emphasizing real-world applicability.
  - Example Sentences:
    - Sentence: "Liquid formulations are most common in paediatrics due to their ease of administration."
      Response: Pragmatic Approach
    - Sentence: "Broad spectrum antibiotics are used because culture data may not identify the infecting bacteria at the time of operation."
      Response: Pragmatic Approach
    - Sentence: "Evidence of Nrf2 inhibition sensitizing SCCs to chemotherapy makes Nrf2 an attractive target for clinical trials."
      Response: Pragmatic Approach

- No Explanation
Definition: The sentence does not provide an explanation.
  - Example Sentences:
    - Sentence: "The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in effect are deleterious to a cell's survival."
      Response: No Explanation
    - Sentence: "Hashimoto et al. showed that 8-OHdG accumulates in rat kidney DNA with age."
      Response: No Explanation
    - Sentence: "It is closely related to the blesmols and is the only species in the genus Heterocephalus."
      Response: No Explanation
