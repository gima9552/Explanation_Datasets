"By contrast, altruistic individuals and environmental ethics supporters will engage in pro-environmental behaviors when the benefits are personal and, critically, even if they are solely environmental (Passmore, 1974; De Dominicis et al., 2017).It is worth noting, for ordinary people who are not involved in NIMBY activities, “The impact of an individual's pro-environmental behavior on its own marginal welfare is rather negligible” (Hartmann et al., 2017: 44).",,,,,,

"Relationship between Levels of Inorganic Pollutants and Characteristics of MothersThe relationships between the heavy metals and trace elements studied and the most significant characteristics of mothers are shown in Table 4.The highest levels of aluminum, nickel, selenium, arsenic, lead, zinc and mercury in breast milk were found in women residing in the industrial and mining zone, which may be due to the fact that the study area is strongly affected by these anthropogenic activities, which make it the zone containing the most severely metal-contaminated sediments in the Mediterranean area [66,67].",,,,,,
Maternal Diet and HabitsThe relationships between the heavy metals and trace elements studied and the most significant diet and habits of mothers are shown in Table 4.,,,,,,
"The Mann-Whitney U-test showed that lead and manganese levels are significantly higher in non-vegetarian women.Despite the fact that fish intake is considered the main source of mercury of non-labor origin, we did not find significant differences in the levels of mercury in the milk of women with high consumption of fish in general, shellfish or tuna (p = 0.539).",,,,,,
Arsenic concentration showed a significant negative correlation with birth weight in our study (rs = −0.392; p = 0.005).,,,,,,
"Cadmium and copper levels were higher in the milk of mothers of children with lower current weight; in turn, arsenic levels were higher in the milk of women with children of a lower birth weight, which would confirm that exposure to high concentrations of certain toxic substances is associated with low infant weight.Diet significantly influences the levels of certain elements in breast milk—for example, the amount of water consumed by the mother was associated with higher concentrations of aluminum and lead; vegetarian diets were associated with higher levels of lead, arsenic, cadmium and manganese; and high consumption of fruit was associated with an increase in copper concentrations.",,,,,,
We will also compare the significance of different EEG channel subsets for emotion recognition and present the relevance of different subsets of EEG channels to emotion recognition.2.,,,,,,
"It has 3-by-3 kernels throughout its convolutional path, except for the very first convolutional layer (Conv 0) which has 7-by-7 kernels.The color coding of Figure 3 denotes the major convolutional blocks of the ResNet.",,,,,,
"Comparing the rudimentary EEG signal sampling point by sampling point across the channels may have considerably taken into account the undesired meaningless voltage variations, resulting in lower classification accuracy in the ResNet18-1D-(S-T-alternate) model.We have also constructed and examined another variant of the ResNet18-1D-(S-then-T) model with its several initial convolutional layers all being spatial-dimension convolution followed by temporal convolution only.",,,,,,
"Electrode Distance to the MidlineWith reference to Figures 5(a) and 5(b), the relevance of different subsets of EEG channels for emotion recognition is investigated, with respect to the channels' distance from the midline.The trend of classification accuracy as reported in Figure 5 follows that the more laterally placed the EEG channels are, the higher the classification accuracy they deliver.",,,,,,
"Using the SEED dataset, our best performing model [ResNet18-1D-(T-then-S)] has achieved a 3-class emotion classification accuracy of 93.42%.Not of less importance, the batch normalization function proves to be essential in tackling the problem of internal covariate shift which can result in model optimization convergence failure.Investigating the EEG channel significance for emotion recognition from the neurological aspects, the laterally placed channels around the temporal lobe show greater importance than the channels placed over other brain regions.",,,,,,
"By BW, the simple linear regression similarly showed a strong relationship between the DE and ME for Hanwoo above and below 350 kg BW: ME = 0.9833 × DE − 0.2760 (R2 = 0.991, RMSE = 0.055, p < 0.001 for the intercept and slope) and ME = 0.72975 × DE + 0.38744 (R2 = 0.913, RMSE = 0.100, p < 0.001 for the intercept and slope), respectively.",,,,,,
"[10] estimated the ME:DE of Hanwoo steers weighing 376.6 and fed rice straw (44%) and concentrate (56%) at three different energy levels (0.8, 1.2 and 1.6 times the maintenance), and the ME:DE ranged between 83% and 90%.",,,,,,
The data included individual treatments from three different studies published in Korean Journals and national reports from 1983 to 2013.,,,,,,
"To estimate the NDF, ADF and EE for the studies that did not provide these data, tabular values for the feed ingredients reported by the Korean Feeding Standards [3] were used to assume the ingredient composition information presented in this paper.",,,,,,

A significant result indicated that the distribution of FG-positive cells constituted a separate population from those that were FG-negative.ResultsThe Central Efferent Vestibular System (EVS)We used a Chat-ChR2 mouse line (n = 5; two males and three females) to explore the precise location and co-ordinates of the EVN nucleus.,,,,,,
Our results suggested only one EVN population or cluster on each side of the brainstem in mice and this was confirmed by our retrograde labeling results (see below).,,,,,,
"In addition, antibody labeling confirmed the simultaneous presence of ChAT and therefore the cholinergic identity of these neurons (Figures 3F–K).",,,,,,
"Note, the EVN (Figures 6E,F), is clearly distinguished from the closest group of GFP-labeled cell bodies in the cholinergic abducens nucleus, located ventral to the facial nerve genu (Figure 6D).Prior to the use of FG as a retrograde tracer, we injected Fast Green dye into the PC to confirm the spread from the PC to the rest of the vestibular portion of the membranous labyrinth (Figure 6A).",,,,,,
"We observed contralateral bound axons crossing the midline of the brainstem, approximately 100 μm more rostral to the level of the EVN neurons, suggesting a rostral-looping trajectory of the contralaterally projecting fibers before they turned back caudally to join ventrally projecting ipsilateral EVN fibers, as they exited towards the eighth nerve.",,,,,,

"Anti-IL-12 treatments and other therapies available for patients in the early stages of disease are hence expected to be effective for curing encephalopathy, as well as for alleviating the associated sequalae.A limitation of this study is that the sample size of patients with encephalopathy caused by virus was too small to demonstrate statistically significant data to support our conclusion, particularly regarding the effects on outcome.Author ContributionsH.K.",,,,,,
"Before the era of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), pediatric Ph+ALL showed a worse prognosis in comparison to other forms of ALL, and was managed with intensive chemotherapy, followed, whenever possible, by allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first morphological complete remission.",,,,,,

"For this reason, it is still necessary to confirm the replicability of such results and further verify the many beneficial effects that have been attributed to (A)XOS consumption.",,,,,,
"The same observed phenomenon happened in another study, at the dose of 10 g XOS per day [88].",,,,,,
"Since (A)XOS with greater effects are the ones with low DP [42,65], a further treatment could be necessary, for example with acids or enzymes [102].",,,,,,

Visual examination of the trajectories confirms the long-lived presence of the ethidium ligands in two main configurations: stacked on the terminal base-pairs or intercalated at the terminal base-pair step.,,,,,,
This could be due to the kinetics and enhanced thermal stability or simply this was not observed because the simulations were not long enough.,,,,,,
"Remembering that we have a simulation with four free binders, ethidium ligand 2, for example, shows a clear intercalation event in the central base-pairs of the GAAC duplex and ligands 1, 3 and 4 present a similar intercalation density close to the terminal base-pairs, noting that since the shown reference DNA is an average structure without ethidium present, the DNA shown does not have the characteristic DNA deformations seen in previous studies of ethidium interaction with duplexes (45).Figure 4.",,,,,,
Radial plot R shows similar molarity values of ∼1–2.5 at very close distance of the GAAC helical axis (intercalation and stacking events) and higher values of ∼2.5–3 molarity close to a value of 10 Å which corresponds to the edge of the GAAC duplex from the minor groove region.Figure 5.,,,,,,

"After an initial testing at 20 and 40 mg/L for 48 h, the later METH concentration was selected for developing the model and the effects on the brain monoaminergic profile, locomotor, anxiety-like and social behaviors as well as on the expression of key genes of the catecholaminergic system were determined.",,,,,,

These results are consistent with the social isolation phenotype suggested by the shoaling test results.,,,,,,
"In this study, the average brain levels of METH 3 h after exposure were 9.19 ng/mg brain tissue suggesting a rapid increase in METH plasmatic levels, explaining some of the behavioral and neurochemical changes found at this time.In mammalian models, after an initial release of DA and 5-HT, acute high doses of METH causes damage to dopaminergic and serotonergic axon terminals in the brain.",,,,,,
"Interestingly, in the shoaling test, an assay where the fish is exposed to the stress associated with handling and the novel environment, but not to social isolation, no effects on mobility were observed 3 h after exposure, a result consistent with that obtained in the locomotor assay, another test performed on shoals.",,,,,,

"Although these trophic modes have also evolved outside the Orchidaceae, no other plant family displays such a high frequency of shifts in trophic modes (Merckx, 2013; Jacquemyn & Merckx, 2019).Traditionally, orchid mycorrhizas have been considered to consist primarily, if not only, of members of the ‘rhizoctonias’ complex, which comprises taxa from three distinct fungal families: Tulasnellaceae, Ceratobasidiaceae and Serendipitaceae (Smith & Read, 2008; Dearnaley et al., 2012), and this association has been regarded as the ancestral state of the family (Yukawa et al., 2009; Dearnaley et al., 2012; Weiß et al., 2016).",,,,,,
"Because a large number of fungal families contain members that are pathogens, endophytes, or belong to unknown ecological guilds, we adopted a conservative approach in all further analyses by restricting the number of fungal families to the 17 families that are known to contain putative orchid mycorrhizal fungi (Table 12.1 in Dearnaley et al., 2012).Based on morphological descriptions and stable isotope signatures (13C and 15N), we assigned orchid species to three trophic modes: autotrophy (AU), partial mycoheterotrophy (PMH), and full mycoheterotrophy (MH).",,,,,,
The orchid chronogram is annotated with subfamilies and tribes represented by three‐letter initials (see the full name in Supporting Information Table S2); the highest posterior probability state of trophic modes is mapped on all internal nodes of the tree based on ancestral state reconstruction (Fig.,,,,,,
"Furthermore, our ‘MultiState’ analyses of trophic mode and symbiotic association showed that the fourth model is favored with the lowest BIC compared with the other three models, which sets constraints on the forward transition from autotrophic states (states 1, 2 and 3) to mycoheterotrophic states (states 4 and 5) (Table 1).",,,,,,
"As the 13C and 15N signatures of only few species have been investigated, and because these isotopes cannot detect low degrees of PMH in orchids, especially for those associated with rhizoctonias (Gebauer et al., 2016; Schiebold et al., 2018; Schweiger et al., 2019), the number of shifts to mycoheterotrophy may have been underestimated here.Transitions to MH occurred dominantly through an intermediate stage of PMH (Figs S5, 6), which is in line with previous phylogenetic studies on narrower phylogenetic scales (Selosse & Roy, 2009; Motomura et al., 2010; Ogura‐Tsujita et al., 2012; Yagame et al., 2016; Jacquemyn & Merckx, 2019).",,,,,,
"The trophic mode shift to mycoheterotrophy seems thus to go in parallel with increased importance of ECM and SAP fungi while gradually discarding the rhizoctonias that were associated with the autotrophic ancestors.In arbuscular and ECM systems, several experimental studies have shown that plants can reward greater nutrient‐providing symbionts with increased carbon supplies, and thus ‘choose’ optimal fungal partners from the local environment (Bever et al., 2009; Kiers et al., 2011; Bogar et al., 2019).",,,,,,

"We obtained comparable FWHM contours using all three models, indicating that the skull geometry is more influential than the skull porosity or soft tissues in rat acoustic modeling.",,,,,,
"Owing to the large focal volume at 0.25 MHz, we found that the effect of the transducer displacement on the targeting accuracy was minor.The single-element transducer was placed at a normal incidence angle to deliver higher acoustic pressure to the focal location effectively [32,48,54,55].",,,,,,

"Together, variants in MYH7 and MYBPC3 are identified in 70% of patients with HCM and a positive result in the genetic analysis [3].Although the hereditary nature of the disease has been known since 1961 [4], MYH7 was the first gene described to cause HCM in 1990 [5,6]; since then, multiple variants capable of producing the disease have been discovered [7,8].Finding a causal variant of the disease in patients with HCM can sometimes help to better assess the proband’s risk; however, above all, it allows the presence of the variant to be evaluated in relatives and the follow-up to be focused on carriers [9].",,,,,,
"The samples were analysed in three different Spanish laboratories: Health in Code (A Coruña, Spain), Imegen (Valencia, Spain), and Unidad de Diagnóstico Molecular y Genética Clínica del Hospital Universitario Son Espases (Mallorca, Spain), according to availability at the time of evaluation of each patient.The technique used for index patients was Sanger or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).",,,,,,

"The empirical specification (after first-differencing) can be expressed: ΔYmit=b0+tt+b1ΔlnUmit-1+b2ΔlnLmit-1+b3ΔXmt-1+b4tijt+b5tmt+ϵmit (3)where Ymit denotes different outcome variables such as the average log hourly wage residual, the hiring rate residual due to plant entry, the quit rate residual due to plant closure, TFP (total factor productivity), log fixed assets, log workforce size or social security uptake.",,,,,,
We thus exploit the fact that regions are differently affected by industry variation depending on their initial industry mix.,,,,,,
"No evidence supporting this notion, is found in levels, nor is it obvious that the variance in unionisation is larger in large cells than small cells, when conditioned on employment changes.How does the predicted growth in regional industry-specific unionisation (our instrument) relates to growth in log regional industry-specific observed unionisation?",,,,,,
"In Model 4, we discard all observations from municipalities not historically unionised.",,,,,,
"If unionisation varies consistently between high and low productivity industries, even within municipalities, this will not influence our estimates.Third, we are less concerned for bias due to labour supply shocks.",,,,,,
"Furthermore, (growth in) log unionisation lagged two periods does not have any significant impact on wages.Fifth, we have cleansed the wage growth from what we would predict based on our instrument, and then examined how this residualised wage growth influences future values of our instrument.",,,,,,
"Thus, overall it appears that increased local unionisation shifts production towards being more capital-intensive.Fifth, when we look closer at the regional productivity growth based on the entry and the exit firms only, we see that when local unionisation grows and causes local productivity growth, firm entry contributes significantly to this result.",,,,,,
"However, we find a strong productivity hike on average and at the top of the productivity distribution following increased local unionisation, while nothing happens at the bottom of the distribution.",,,,,,

"Muscle oxygen saturation (% SmO2) during reported muscle strength exercises showed a decreasing trend after a muscle strength protocol; that is, before the protocol (range = 68.07–77.9%) and after (range = 9.50–46.09%).",,,,,,
"However, to our knowledge, no information has yet been found that clearly indicates the baseline data provided by NIRS and its possible variation during muscle strength training in healthy adults, information that could improve our understanding of the mechanisms that influence physical performance and fatigue during this type of exercise, since blood flow can vary depending on the workload and metabolic demand [20], conditioning the response of this tissue to physical exercise [21].",,,,,,
"However, despite the lack of research in the area of resistance training and SmO2, the compilation of information presented in this work may contribute to position NIRS devices as an instrument to be used during muscle strength training as a useful alternative, being functional and low cost during the evaluation and planning of muscle strength protocols, optimizing the prescription and management of physical performance in healthy adults.Another relevant aspect to discuss is that in all the selected articles, SmO2 was evaluated in the vastus lateralis quadriceps, a coincidence that seems interesting to analyze when selecting a SmO2 evaluation protocol since the choice of muscles to evaluate this variable using a NIRS could influence the changes in muscle oxygenation and affect what is expressed by these devices, especially when large muscles with heterogeneous characteristics on their surface are evaluated; for example, literature has been found that evidence divergences for the VL versus rectus femoris quadriceps [36] or proximal versus distal gastrocnemius [37], therefore, special care must be taken regarding the use of a single site to predict the responses of the entire muscle or limb.",,,,,,

"It is likely that the egg-cell-specific promoter causes mutations more efficiently than the 35S promoter, as mentioned above (Wang et al., 2015).Since the 3 nt deletion did not cause a frameshift, and resulted in only an amino acid deletion, the generation of complete CsFAD2 KO Camelina plants with increased MUFA contents could not be ensured.",,,,,,
"This is similar to the finding that a dwarf Arabidopsis T-DNA mutant showed reduced apical dominance, decreased seed set, and slow growth (Feldmann et al., 1989).",,,,,,

Chemotherapeutic options for CL have changed little in over 50 years [14]; those medicines remains expensive and questions are still unanswered about their effectiveness and safety [15].,,,,,,
"In a similar fashion, we assumed that a CL prophylactic vaccine, while protecting individuals, will have less impact on transmission given the zoonotic nature of this disease, hence immunization will not be stopped in any CL at-risk area.",,,,,,
"Whilst our modelling assumptions include transmission by asymptomatic cases of VL, a recent study from India suggests that this may be more limited than previously thought [10].",,,,,,

"In susceptible erythroid Gb4 knockout cells, incoming viruses were arrested in the endosomal compartment, showing no cytoplasmic spreading of capsids as observed in Gb4-expressing cells.",,,,,,

"It is known that mechanical disorders, such as disturbed tensile strength, nerve gliding disturbance (the limited movement of the neural structures relative to other tissues) or compression (pressure-induced deformation) of the nerve, may decrease neural tissue extensibility and cause irritation.",,,,,,
"Current studies analysing tensioning techniques revealed neuroimmune, neurophysiological, and neurochemical effects in the structures of the nervous system [4].Previous studies have demonstrated various tests such as (1) the upper limb neurodynamic test 1 (ULNT1), which assesses length and mobility of the peripheral NS in an upper limb [8,9], (2) the straight leg raise (SLR) test with ankle dorsiflexion, which is often used in patients with back and lower limb pain [10,11,12,13], or (3) the slump (SLUMP) test, which assess the correlations between the patient’s symptoms and movement limitations in the pain-sensitive structures located in the spinal canal and intervertebral foramen [10,12].",,,,,,
"In establishing the goals of IS treatment, experts of the International Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) indicated aesthetics, quality of life, and disability as the most important.",,,,,,
"It is worth conducting similar studies in different age categories among adolescents in the future.For this study, three neurodynamic tests whose reliability had been previously confirmed in different groups of participants were selected: the ULNT1 [14,15,16], SLR [13,19,41], and SLUMP test [17,18].",,,,,,
"However, participants with deformation over 30° showed a significantly lower range of motion in the SLUMPleft test than participants with less severe scoliosis, which may indicate some relationship between spine deformation and MNS.Statistical analysis of painless participants showed increased mechanosensitivity in ULNT1 and SLUMP tests in adolescents with IS.",,,,,,
"However, due to many variables such as Cobb angle, number and location of curvatures, the dominance of one of the curves in double-curve scoliosis, value of ATR, alignment in the sagittal plane, pain incidence, gender, hypermobility, the relationship between the left/right asymmetry and direction of the curvatures was not analysed in detail in this study.",,,,,,
Earlier studies have also shown limitations in the range of rotation of the trunk and pelvis in adolescent girls with IS [46].,,,,,,
A localised pain in different parts of the body occurred more often in participants with curvature angles higher than 30° (50.0%) than in patients with scoliosis below 30° (31.1%) or in healthy individuals (14%).,,,,,,
"Although the possibility of combining MRI data points from different scanner hardware is appealing, this is challenging because scanner‐dependent geometric distortions and differences in tissue contrast can be problematic (Gunter et al., 2009).When considering the potential for two different field strengths to yield different estimates of the same brain measurements, interpretation should be tempered by the finding that even same‐scanner measurements, taken twice or more over short periods, are not perfectly reliable.",,,,,,
"WM volume was estimated as 7.0% greater at 3 T than at 1.5 T. Conversely, total CSF volume was estimated as 4.4% lower at 3 T than at 1.5 T. Scatter plots (Figure 2a) indicated that the between scanner relationships were largely linear (slopes between 0.688 and 1.048), and the Bland–Altman plots showed that there were few participants >2 SD from the mean difference (Figure 2b).FIGURE 2 Between‐scanner comparison of T1‐weighted data: (a) scatter plots of six volumetric measures identified using FreeSurfer 6.0 for 91 participants scanned at both 1.5 and 3 T, where the continuous blue line shows linear fit with 95% CI; (b) Bland–Altman plots of the same six measures showing the mean of between‐scanner volumes and the difference between these volumes where the blue line indicates the mean and the red lines represent ±2 SDs.",,,,,,
"The lower values for WM could be explained by the discrepancy in GM/WM segmentation between 1.5 and 3 T, by which the whole‐brain measures were unaffected.3.5 Between‐scanner agreement of major WM tractsThe mean values and the between‐scanner differences of 12 WM tracts are reported in Table S7 and summarized in Table 2.",,,,,,
"For gMD, the first unrotated principal component explained 44% of the variance at 1.5 T and 56% at 3 T. For gFA, the first principal component explained 35% of the variance at 1.5 T and 31% at 3 T. Both gMD and gFA provided excellent between‐scanner consistency (ICCs of .850 and .769, respectively), which was ~.3 greater than the mean ICC of the 12 tracts (Figure 6b and Table S7).3.6 Between‐scanner comparison of connectomeMD‐ and FA‐weighted whole‐brain networks were computed allowing 3,570 possible connections for unthresholded networks, but only 1,071 connections were retained after consistency‐thresholding at 30%.",,,,,,
"Node abbreviations are listed in Table S10The ICCs for each of the 1,071 individual connections which were retained following 30% network thresholding are shown in Figure 7c.",,,,,,
"Indeed, the contribution of pipeline differences was borne out in our supplementary analyses: applying a different pipeline to 3 T substantially affected dMRI measures in a small sample of our participants and FA increased substantially in WM tracts using more recent processing algorithms, which provided better distortion corrections (FA tends to increase with better distortion correction; Yamada et al., 2014).",,,,,,
"A previous between‐scanner comparison showed that reliability is typically better when the same scanner manufacture was used than when different scanner manufactures were used (Jovicich et al., 2009).",,,,,,

"Note that transfected SMO is constitutively active in HEK293 cells because its inhibitor PTCH1 is present at minimal levels [32,33,41,42], whereas M2AchR requires carbachol for activity.",,,,,,
"This result cannot be explained by issues with receptor expression, trafficking, or ligand stimulation, because carbachol treatment of M2AchR-expressing cells readily blocked AC-evoked reporter activation (S1G Fig).",,,,,,
"We therefore hypothesize that the pCT provides the core determinants of PKA-C binding, while other regions of SMO may boost the efficiency of the interaction.To verify the conclusions of our BRET studies biochemically, we tested whether SMO and PKA-C copurify from detergent-solubilized HEK293 cells expressing both proteins.",,,,,,
Control immunoblots confirmed efficient expression of PKA-R in these experiments (S7B Fig; see also Fig 3C).,,,,,,
"Taken together, these findings show that GRK phosphorylation mediates the activity-dependent binding of SMO to PKA-C.GRK2/3 phosphorylation of conserved SMO pCT residues mediates PKA-C bindingA parsimonious interpretation of the above results is that PKA-C recruitment to SMO is dependent on GRK2/3-mediated phosphorylation of the SMO intracellular domains.",,,,,,
"Consequently, it was unknown whether the physiological target of GRKs in the Hh pathway is SMO or a different protein altogether [4,75,76,105].",,,,,,
"However, our mutational analysis suggests that this complex involves, at minimum, the phosphorylated pCT of SMO and the N-tail domain of PKA-C. Membrane lipid interactions may also contribute to these complexes, as the N-tail is myristoylated which can increase PKA-C membrane association in some settings [58, 63,109,110].",,,,,,
"Interestingly, prior studies using conventional immunofluorescence microscopy did not report SMO/PKA-C colocalization in cilia [20,26].",,,,,,

"We recently explained10 why aCAR from near-surface peat cannot be reliably compared to the long-term rate of C accumulation obtained from a deeper layer within a peat core, which may be several centuries, or more, old.",,,,,,
"To address these misunderstandings, and to expand on the explanations given in10, we present and discuss here the results from a simple numerical model based on Clymo’s14 work and a more detailed computer model of peatland development.",,,,,,
"NCB may be obtained directly by measuring atmosphere-peatland C exchanges using flux towers and by measuring C losses in water discharging from a peatland (e.g.29,30).Conceptualising the acrotelm effectTo illustrate how the acrotelm effect arises we first use a very simple numerical model where litter produced by peatland plants is added to the peatland surface as cohorts or layers.",,,,,,
"NCB denotes the actual or real rate of net C accumulation and is given by the gains of C (in new litter) minus the loss of C from the decay of the older peat cohorts for each Δt, as shown in the boxes above the columns.",,,,,,
"This situation is similar to that modelled by Clymo14, with the main difference being that peat below the water table in Scenario 2 is assumed not to decay at all (Clymo14 allowed for a low rate of decay).",,,,,,
"As with Scenario 1, aCAR erroneously suggests that the net rate of C accumulation has increased to the present, and only one of the aCAR values corresponds to NCB (0.1), now for Δt5 (layer 5).",,,,,,
"During the drought in Δt10 the water table falls to the top of layer 1, exposing previously ‘protected’ peat in layers 2–5 to oxic decay (secondary decay).Other scenarios in addition to the three discussed here are possible, such as ones that include changes in rates of litter production as well as changes in decay in response to drought (a modification of Scenario 3), and these may even lead to a decrease in aCAR towards the top of a core.",,,,,,
"What this simple analysis shows is that measurements in the acrotelm alone cannot, except in special cases, be used to provide information on the overall C balance of a peatland.",,,,,,
The increases in NCB near to the beginning and end of the net rainfall perturbation (a and b) are due to the peatland water tables falling and later rising into the zone of maximum litter addition in DigiBog’s litter production equation.Our more detailed model shows aCAR and NCB (Fig.,,,,,,
In this instance it might seem reasonable that aCAR can be used to indicate NCB.,,,,,,
"There follows a significant increase in aCAR ‘apparently’ indicating that C accumulation is also increasing when, in fact, the peatland is losing C as shown by NCB.",,,,,,
assessing a peatland’s C balance requires that all of the peatland profile is taken into account and not just a dated section of it—our results apply to all peatlands in all circumstances.,,,,,,
"Given that aCAR is based on a mistaken use of the balance equation and can give the wrong sign of NCB as well as the opposite trend, we believe that it should no longer be acceptable to use aCAR to indicate changes in NCB.Our simulations produce virtual and not real peat cores, and, by necessity, all models are simplifications of reality.",,,,,,
"The perturbations show the timing and duration of the deviations from the baseline simulation inputs.Calculating aCAR and NCB from model outputsIn DigiBog, new peat layers are added to each column at the end of every year of a simulation.",,,,,,
